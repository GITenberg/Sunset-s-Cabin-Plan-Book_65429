<h2><span class="small">FOREWORD</span></h2>
<p>Every Westerner wants a &ldquo;vacation home&rdquo;!
Perhaps it is the nearness to pioneer days
that makes us so alive to mountain forests and
ocean sands. <i>Sunset&rsquo;s Cabin Plan Book</i> is primarily
for those who are still in the &ldquo;talking
stage.&rdquo; However, there is much valuable information
in its pages for those who already
are enjoying the pleasures of a &ldquo;second home,&rdquo;
where they spend week-ends and vacation days,
living comfortably though simply at any time
of the year, while enjoying our Western heritage
of the great outdoors.</p>
<p>The planning of a mountain cabin or beach
cottage deserves just as careful and thoughtful
consideration as the planning of a real home,
though the actual construction is likely to be
on a fairly simple scale.</p>
<p>The size of the cabin, whether it is built of
logs, stone or finished lumber, depends upon
what you intend to use it for&mdash;a week-end cottage
for yourself and your family, a hunting
lodge, a vacation home, or a little place where
you can go off and examine the state of your
soul in the quiet of the woods. You should consider
the number in the family and the number
of guests likely to be included, for &ldquo;week-end
cabin&rdquo; should not be a synonym for active discomfort.
Crowding may
be jolly for a few hours
or possibly for one
night, but seldom longer
than that.</p>
<p>The collection of
cabin plans in this book
is representative of what
we believe to be the best
in Western vacation-home
designing. The
floor plans embody features
that may be shifted
from one to another,
since these are not necessarily
working plans,
but suggestions around
which you and your architect
or contractor-builder
can create a
cabin to fill your own
needs. The same holds
true of the cabin
sketches themselves. You need not sheathe your
cabin in bevel siding just because it&rsquo;s that way
in the picture. The same plan can be used for
a shingle house or one of board and batten.</p>
<p>No attempt has been made to set down detailed
instructions for building any particular
cabin, since no two are exactly alike, but we
have tried to present the information needed by
an amateur who wants to build his own place
or oversee the work of a crew of country laborers.
In addition to the cabin plans and visualizations
there are numerous pages of cabin lore
gathered from many sources as well as from the
practical experiences of the Sunset Staff.</p>
<p>Cost estimates have been omitted purposely,
as there are so many factors affecting the price
of materials, labor, and transportation in various
localities. Figures based on one locality
would not hold good in another. The distance
from sources of supply is also an influence, because
materials hauled only a few miles would
cost far less than if they were shipped a hundred
miles and then transported by truck to the
cabin site. Really, the only satisfactory answer
to the cost problem is to take your plans to a
builder in the neighborhood of your locality
and get his figures. Or if you plan to do some
of the work yourself
with local labor, your
lumberman may be
able to help you with
cost estimates. If you
want an individual and
specialized design, the
services of an architect
should be seriously
considered.</p>
<p>We hope the ideas in
this <i>Cabin Plan Book</i>
not only be inspiring
but also so practical
and usable.</p>
<p><i>Note: Working drawings
of the cabin plans are not
available. This is in
keeping with the publisher&rsquo;s
policy to furnish
ideas but not an
architectural service.</i></p>

</div>
<p>Since you have decided to build a vacation
home, your first problem is to find a location.
The whole family will have something to
say about this&mdash;half the fun of building a cabin
or beach house is the planning of various details
in family councils. No doubt, by the time
you discover the region in which you would
like to build, friends will have told you many
of the important things to look for. However,
here are a number that should help you.</p>
<p>If it is to be a summer vacation home and
you have a car, the distance from home isn&rsquo;t so
important, because the Pacific Coast&rsquo;s network
of fine roads offers easy access to almost every
area. On the other hand, if you are going to be
a &ldquo;week-ender,&rdquo; don&rsquo;t choose a site too far
away. It isn&rsquo;t fun to spend most of your weekend
traveling to and from the cabin, and your
friends will avoid you&mdash;but perhaps that&rsquo;s your
intention!</p>
<p>Cost of construction is important. It&rsquo;s all
very well to build a place out in the wilds, but
the farther you go from civilization the more
it costs to transport men and materials to your
cabin site.</p>
<h3>Watch the Distance</h3>
<p>With the whole Pacific Coast to choose from
it shouldn&rsquo;t be too hard to find an area that
suits all the family. You will be smart to pick
a spot not more than an easy day&rsquo;s drive from
home. If it is only a few hours away, so much
the better. Within less than one day&rsquo;s drive
from most points on the Pacific Coast you can
lose yourself in a paradise of forests, lakes and
mountains, or stand on the ocean shore and
hear the breakers boom.</p>
<p>Naturally, you&rsquo;ll want to invest most of your
money in the cabin or beach house itself. That
being the case the best place to go for low-cost
mountain cabin sites is the United States Forest
Service, which controls millions of acres of the
finest timber and mountain country in the
world. Beach property, on the other hand, is
largely a commercial proposition, and you&rsquo;ll
more than likely have to consult your real estate
dealer.</p>
<p>The National Forests offer cabin sites to suit
every taste and every purse. However, certain
areas are not open to settlement, and all cabins
must conform to standards set by the Forest
Service. You can&rsquo;t buy the land, but you can
occupy it under Special Use Permit. You get
low cost, freedom from crowding and assurance
that the area will not be ruined by commercialization.</p>
<p>The Forest Service opens new tracts for summer
cabin sites when those opened in previous
years are filled. Cabins are not crowded together
as they are in some commercial tracts.</p>
<h3>Many Sites Available</h3>
<p>There are eighteen National Forests in California
alone and dozens of others in the western
states offering a diversity of climate and natural
conditions. Of course, not all of the forests
are available for cabin sites, but there is a large
group from which to select. Most of the tracts
available in National Forests are in groups of
from six to one hundred lots or more, each lot
averaging about &#8531; acre, depending upon
topography and cover.</p>
<p>To obtain a cabin permit from the Forest
Service, write or call on the Supervisor or nearest
Ranger of the particular forest in which you
think you&rsquo;d like to live. Ask him what areas, if
any, are open in his National Forest. If he has
a forest officer available, he will arrange for
him to visit the property with you. A personal
visit is desirable but not absolutely necessary
before applying for a permit.</p>
<p>Application for permit may be made in writing
to the Forest Supervisor, or Forest Ranger,
specifying the location of the property, the use
to be made of it (summer cabin, hotel or resort)
and the estimated cost of the improvements
you intend to make.</p>
<p>Permits are granted strictly on a &ldquo;first come&mdash;first
served&rdquo; basis. The cost&mdash;and this will
amaze you&mdash;averages about $15 per year for
<span class="pb" id="Page_4">4</span>
cabin sites, depending on the size and location
of the property. Each permit is renewable annually.
You may sell your cabin at any time,
but the transaction must be approved by the
Forest Service.</p>

</div>
<p>Don&rsquo;t depend on your own knowledge of the
outdoors when you pick a cabin site. The local
forest officer knows more about his particular
locality than anyone else, and he&rsquo;ll be glad to
help you.</p>
<p>When seeking information about a particular
forest, be sure you write to the officer in
<i>charge of that forest</i>, because he is the only one
with a complete file of data on it. If you don&rsquo;t
know who your nearest forest supervisor is,
write to the nearest regional forester. Here&rsquo;s a
list of offices:</p>
<p class="revint"><i>Region No. 1</i> (Northern Idaho, Montana, South
Dakota, Western Washington)&mdash;Federal Bldg.,
Missoula, Montana</p>
<p class="revint"><i>Region No. 2</i> (Colorado, Nebraska, Oklahoma,

Milwaukee, Wisconsin</p>
<p class="revint"><i>Region No. 10</i> (Alaska)&mdash;Federal
Territorial Bldg., Juneau,
Alaska</p>
<p>When you apply for a permit,
you must agree to install permanent
improvements costing at
least $500, including labor. Only
one residence may be constructed
on a lot, and in order to
prevent the erection of unsightly
&ldquo;shacks&rdquo;&mdash;some people&rsquo;s ideas
on cabins would surprise you&mdash;each
permitee must submit his
plans for approval <i>before</i> a permit will be
issued.</p>
<p>All buildings and all roofs must be painted,
oiled or stained. If paint is used, the color must
harmonize with the forest background, and be
approved by the Forest Supervisor. That does
not mean that everything has to be brown and
green, but the forest is no place for a pink
stucco cottage.</p>
<p>Permanent construction must be completed
by the end of the second season after the permit
is issued.</p>
<p>Cabins built under &ldquo;special use&rdquo; permits
must be occupied at least fifteen days each year
by the permittee or his family, unless special
arrangement is made with the Forest Service.</p>
<p>The principal requirements of the Forest
Service regarding cabins are that they be built
in a workmanlike manner with substantial
roofs, floors, doors, windows, brick or masonry
chimneys, toilets and garbage containers of a
type approved by the Forest Supervisor. The
general ensemble must be in harmony with the
forest background. You don&rsquo;t have to build
your house just like your neighbor&rsquo;s, but all
cabins do have to be of an approved and attractive
rustic style.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_5">5</div>
<p>In large colonies you may be required to install
a chemical toilet or septic tank, a piped
water system, or other improvements to safeguard
the general health of the community.
Ask about these things.</p>
<p>If you build in a colony of summer homes,
you must agree to abide by any rules and regulations
agreed upon by a majority of the permit
holders if they have or organize a cooperative
public service group.</p>
<p>Choice of the actual site for a mountain
cabin depends on drainage, view, shelter from
storms, sunlight, ease of access, and so on.
Probably the best location is one on a gentle
slope, which assures that rain and snow will
drain off, with the front of the cabin facing the
center of interest and the principal windows
placed to catch the prevailing breezes.</p>
<p>A slope is somewhat more difficult to build
on than flat land, but in wet weather you won&rsquo;t
find puddles in front of the door and the floor
won&rsquo;t get damp. Remember, you don&rsquo;t have tile
sewers to carry off the water. Too steep a hillside
makes building even more expensive, calling
either for excavation or extra foundations.
While a hillside site is attractive, it&rsquo;s pretty
tiresome lugging supplies up hill.</p>
<p>If you build on a slope or hillside, find out
about the normal rainfall. You may need a
watershed at the upper side of your lot to keep
the run-off from trickling down into your
cabin. A shallow ditch or a low wall is enough
protection&mdash;but a necessary one. (See <a href="#fig1">Fig. 1</a>.)</p>
<p>Here are a few other details to think about:
How near is the lot to a good road? It doesn&rsquo;t
have to be close to a main highway, but is it
possible to reach your lot with a fair amount of
convenience? Can you get supplies or help in
case of emergency without too great effort?
Next, how&rsquo;s the water supply?</p>
<p>Water is one of the most important considerations.
The forest officer can tell you what the
stage of the water table is at your location, and
you can decide what kind of well you will need.
Above all, don&rsquo;t plan to use the local trout
stream or lake for drinking water. It may be a
lovely lake, and the stream may ripple over
pretty stones like tinkling bells, but pretty
water isn&rsquo;t necessarily pure water.</p>
<p>There are in the National Forests a number
of associations of Special Use Permittees.
These associations are formed partly for the
advantages of collective bargaining and partly
for the installation of certain facilities on a
tract basis. Many of these associations have installed
water systems, financed by assessments
against the lot owners.</p>
<p>The winter climate is an important factor if
you build in the snow country. In the mountains
you may get snow ten feet or more in
depth&mdash;and ten feet of snow weighs a lot. That
requires extra sturdy construction of the cabin
roof.</p>
<p>Actually, in a National Forest you&rsquo;ll find
that a good deal of the selection has been done
by the Service for you. About all you have to
do is to find the particular one that is most
pleasing to the whole family and offers the
greatest possibilities consistent with the money
you have to spend. You can be absolutely sure
that you will get the lot you pick out. Nor need
you worry that after you get your pet cabin
built someone else will build &ldquo;Ye Olde Hot
Dogge Shoppe&rdquo; across the road.</p>
<p>In selecting a site for a beach house don&rsquo;t be
led into buying too close to the water. Remember
that ocean storms often send the waves far
up on land, so be sure to get expert advice on
the safety of your location.</p>

<div class="img">
<img src="images/p04.jpg" id="ncfig3" alt="YOUR WATER SUPPLY AND SANITARY FACILITIES" width="500" height="124" />
</div>
<p>One of the first major problems that confronts
the city dweller starting the construction
of a summer home is the water supply&mdash;or
lack of it. Not only is water hard to get,
comparatively speaking, but it is not always
safe to use when obtained unless care is taken
to see that its source is pure. Water cannot safely
be declared fit for human consumption unless
the surface of the well or spring remains
permanently above the level of all nearby
sources of pollution. Tight well platforms and
casings, clean grounds and wide separation
from probable channels of impure drainage are
the best safeguards.</p>
<h3>Power Pump Most Convenient</h3>
<p>If you are content to pump your water by
hand and do without a flush-type toilet and bath
or shower, then a dug well with a bucket and
windlass or one with a hand pump is sufficient.
On the other hand, if you are wise you will
install a small power pump&mdash;the cost is quite
reasonable&mdash;and a storage tank, which can be
either in the top of the house or on some nearby
high ground. In estimating the amount of water
you&rsquo;ll need figure that the average bath takes
30 gallons, one flush of a toilet 4 to 6 gallons.</p>
<p>Government experts estimate the consumption
of water per person in 24 hours is 4 to 8
gallons if only a hand pump is provided; if one
faucet is installed, domestic uses require 7 to
15 gallons per person; if the house is equipped
with hot and cold water in kitchen, bath and
laundry, the consumption rises to 20-25 gallons,
a family average of 100 gallons every 24 hours.
That&rsquo;s a lot of water to carry in pails or pump
by hand.</p>
<p>If you build your cabin in the mountains,
you may not have much success digging a well
because bedrock may be close beneath the surface.
If you build in or near some community
of vacation homes, you can find out what
method others employ in the neighborhood. In
the more established communities you may find
a co-operative water system in existence. Many
of the privately developed summer home areas
are served by local utility companies.</p>
<h3>Test Your Water Frequently</h3>
<p>If you are lucky enough to have a spring on
your property, the water will probably be good&mdash;but
test it first, and test it periodically thereafter&mdash;at
least once a year. Then build a tight
covering for the spring to keep out dirt and
wandering animals and pipe the water to your
house. (See <a href="#imgx2">illustration below</a>.)</p>
<div class="img" id="imgx2">
<img src="images/p04d.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="320" />
<p class="pcap">Cover your spring and fence it to keep
out animals. The ditch helps prevent
surface water from contaminating your
house supply.</p>
</div>
<p>In some localities sub-surface conditions may
be satisfactory for a dug well. It takes at least
two men and a lot of work. One digs the earth
out and the other raises it by a bucket and windlass.
<span class="pb" id="Page_7">7</span>
Such a well
should be lined with
concrete or vitrified
pipe and should have
a tight covering. The
best covering is a concrete
well curb and a
concrete or heavy
wooden lid through
which the pump pipe
passes. A man-hole
must be built, too, to allow entry for cleaning
the well occasionally. (See <a href="#fig2">Fig. 2</a>.)</p>
<div class="img" id="fig2">

<dt>HOLE FOR PIPE TO PUMP</dt>
<dt>CEMENTED JOINTS</dt>
<dt>CONCRETE OR CLAY</dt>
<dt>MANHOLE COVER</dt></dl>
<p>A driven well, which is successful in some
locations, can be made by two men also, although
it&rsquo;s not an easy job. The point, a special
length of pipe with a sharp steel point and
screened openings to let the water in, is driven
into the earth with a heavy maul or with a
weight on a block and tackle. It is not practicable
to sink such a well over 100 feet&mdash;a
drilled well is easier and less trouble.</p>
<p>The ultimate source of your water supply
should be definitely determined before you buy
or lease a summer homesite. Before you start
a well of any kind you would be wise to obtain
the best available local advice.</p>
<h3>Sanitation Important</h3>
<p>The average city dweller is likely to overlook
the important part sanitation plays in his daily
life. Therefore, many summer homes are
equipped with meager facilities for disposing
of sewage. The old-fashioned &ldquo;outhouse&rdquo; which
plays a rather comic part in song and story
favored by such humorists as the late Chick Sale
and James Whitcomb Riley, can hardly be considered
an asset to the health and sanitation of
a summer home community.</p>
<p>If such a building is necessary, at least follow
the instructions given by the Department
of Agriculture (see Farmer&rsquo;s Bulletin No.
1227) so that it will be sanitary, fly-proof,
easily cleaned, and as little of an &ldquo;eye sore&rdquo;
as possible. A better
type is the vault-privy
with a watertight concrete
vault, wide and
shallow. It should
have a trap at the rear
to provide access for
cleaning. A metal
container may be substituted
for the concrete
work. This should
have an airtight lid and must be removed frequently
for cleaning.</p>
<p>There are a number of chemical septic tanks
for sale, all of which dispose of waste matter by
the action of bacteria and chemicals. They are
not difficult to install. Further information may
be obtained from the previously-mentioned
Government bulletin.</p>
<h3>Garbage Harbors Germs</h3>
<p>Even though your cabin has running water
and a regular flush toilet, the danger of waste
disposal is not entirely eliminated. Garbage
and refuse of all kinds are harbors for germs
and flies can quickly spread disease germs
gathered from such sources. The location of the
water supply in relation to sewage disposal is
of greatest importance, and it is not enough that
the water source be above the distribution field
of the sewer. It is a good idea to consult the
nearest forest ranger, or some other person who
is well acquainted with the locality, before making
any such installations.</p>
<p>For sink drainage and kitchen waste a line of
small sewer pipes, laid as shown in the accompanying
<a href="#imgx3">diagram</a>, is fairly adequate. Garbage
and other refuse that cannot be drained away
should be buried in a good-sized pit. This hole
should be as nearly fly-proof as possible, and
each fresh lot of refuse should be well covered
with dirt or sand or sprinkled with a chloride
of lime solution.</p>

<div class="img">
<img src="images/p05.jpg" id="ncfig4" alt="CABIN FOUNDATIONS" width="500" height="115" />
</div>
<p>Foundations are the backbone of your cabin.
From the structural standpoint they are
probably the most important part of the building.
So, just because they are going to be hidden,
don&rsquo;t skimp or hurry through with them
because you want to get started quickly on the
cabin itself. If the basic framework is out of
line, the whole house will sag and tilt at odd
angles. As one cabin expert says, &ldquo;Wear out
your spirit level and try-square&mdash;don&rsquo;t save
them for another job.&rdquo;</p>
<p>One of the simplest foundations for the amateur
builder is made by resting the sills on supports
made of two large somewhat flat boulders.
If your cabin site is on solid rock, then all that
is necessary is to bed the bottom boulder securely
on the rock. But if the terrain is ordinary
earth, you should dig down past the &ldquo;forest
floor&rdquo; of black humus until you reach rock,
sand, gravel or other solid ground below the
frost line. Then you pour concrete piers to the
grade level and seat your boulders thereon, as
shown in <a href="#fig3">Fig. 3</a>. <i>Do not</i> use any mortar between
the two boulders. Dampness will creep up past
the first boulder, but if it is not bonded to the
top boulder with mortar, the dampness will
stop there and not reach the post supports or
sill timbers of your cabin. Of course the concrete
piers themselves, if built above grade, are
perfectly good supports for the sills. But the
boulders have more of a cabin &ldquo;look.&rdquo;</p>

</div>
<dl class="undent pcap"><dt>WOODEN FORM FOR PIERS</dt></dl>
<p>The number of foundation supports or piers
will be determined by the size of the house.
&ldquo;Not less than seven feet on centers&rdquo; is a good
rule of thumb.</p>
<p>Concrete piers are not hard to make. Their
size will depend on how deep you must dig to
reach solid earth or rock. First, build several
tapered box forms of rough lumber. (<a href="#fig4">Fig. 4</a>.)
These should be about 24 inches square at the
bottom and taper to about 12 inches at the top.
The taper makes it easier to get the forms off
the finished concrete. Pour a footing of concrete
at least 10 inches thick and six inches larger
than the bottom of the pier on all sides. Then
set the form for the pier on top of this footing.</p>
<p>A satisfactory mixture for foundation piers
is <i>one part</i> Portland cement, <i>two parts</i> clean
<span class="pb" id="Page_9">9</span>
sand, and <i>three parts</i> gravel&mdash;two-inch aggregate
is about right. It is a good idea to add to
the mixture hydrated lime&mdash;about 10 per cent
of the bulk of the cement&mdash;to prevent the mass
from setting too rapidly and to make it work
more smoothly.</p>
<p>This type of foundation allows perfect ventilation
under the cabin, but it will not keep
out wandering rabbits and other night prowlers.</p>
<p>A boulder foundation is quite enough for the
average semi-permanent summer cabin unless
you plan to spend time there during the winter,
in which case an all-around foundation is advisable
to keep out the cold.</p>
<p>Full concrete or rock foundations are more
expensive and more work to build but hard to
beat for permanence. To construct them, dig a
trench to the dimensions of your cabin but at
least twice as wide as your finished foundation
wall is to be and to solid ground below the frost
line. Pour in a &ldquo;footing&rdquo; of concrete to a depth
of 10 inches. This base will distribute the
weight of the cabin. (<a href="#fig5">Fig. 5</a>.) On this footing
build wooden form walls to the proper height&mdash;about
one foot above ground level at the highest
point of your grade is usual&mdash;and fill them up
with the proper mixture of concrete. To prevent
dry rot of the wood construction, air vents
should be constructed at intervals in the concrete
wall above grade. These should be covered
with screening to keep small animals out.
Thickness of foundation walls varies according
to the weight of the building. A good rule is to
make the top of the foundation two inches wider
than the logs or timbers it is to support.</p>

<dt>CROSS SECTION <span class="smaller">OF</span> FOUNDATION WALL</dt></dl>
<p>The sill logs or timbers are laid on top of
the foundation. If your cabin is to be of logs,
select a number of the strongest and straightest
and lay them so as to form the outside &ldquo;frame&rdquo;
of the cabin. They should be bolted tightly to
the concrete by means of long iron bolts previously
buried in the foundation walls. If the sills
are to rest on piers or boulders, spike them together.
The weight of the cabin will hold the
sills in place. The 2&times;6 floor joists are cut in or
notched over the sills. They should be set with
the 2-inch side uppermost and securely spiked.</p>
<p>The footing for the fireplace is made just like
the concrete foundations&mdash;6 or 8 inches beyond
the dimensions of the fireplace plus the hearth.
Pour a slab of concrete about 10 inches deep,
in which are buried &frac12; inch steel rods laid in
both directions&mdash;checkerboard fashion&mdash;and
wired at the intersections. This may seem like a
lot of extra work but the steel rods prevent
settling and cracking. On this slab build a
wooden form to the height of the bottom of the
floor joists and fill with a mixture of concrete,
sand and plenty of small boulders. At this point
block off the section to be used for the hearth
and fill in the fireplace proper up to the floor
level. This will leave a space to be filled in later
with hearthstones, brick or whatever you decide
to use for the hearth.</p>

</div>
<p>If the chapters in this book were arranged in
the order of their importance from the standpoint
of cabin features, this one, dealing with
fireplaces and chimneys, would probably come
first. No matter what other ideas you may have
about a vacation cabin you will undoubtedly insist
on a fireplace as a dominant feature. To
most people a cabin without one just isn&rsquo;t a
cabin at all.</p>
<p>When it comes to building it you can have
the work done a lot easier than you can do it
yourself. On the other hand, you&rsquo;ll probably do
a lot of arguing with the mason because, strange
as it seems, there appear to be comparatively
few masons who can build a fireplace and a
chimney that will work to perfection. The instructions
here have been collected from people
who do know how, and if you follow them, you
should have a successful fireplace.</p>
<p>In the preceding chapter you have read about
the fireplace foundation. By the time the rest
of the house is pretty well along this should be
in good condition for the next step.</p>
<p>A fireplace consists of four essential parts:
the fire box itself, the throat, the smoke chamber,
and the flue. The shape and relationship of
these are very important. One simple relation
to remember is that the area of the fireplace
opening should not be
more than 10 times the
area of the flue. Some
people say 12 times, but
10 is a better average.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig6">

<dt>THROAT</dt>
<dt>8&Prime;</dt>
<dt>FIREPLACE</dt></dl>
<p>The over-all dimensions
of the fireplace,
including mantel, are
matters of proportion
and taste, governed by
the size and shape of
the room. In almost
every case the width of
the opening should exceed
the height. The
top of the opening
should be at least 30
inches from the floor
but not much more than
40 inches unless it is at least six feet wide&mdash;and
not many cabins can stand a fireplace as big as
that. For a six-foot opening plan for a depth of
about 24 inches. No fireplace should have a
depth of less than 18 inches. Remember, however,
that the deeper your fire box the less efficient
it will be for heating purposes. The hearth
should extend at least a foot on either side of the
opening and have a minimum depth of 20
inches.</p>
<p>You may have the opening flush with the
hearth, or, as some builders prefer, lay a course
of stone several inches high across the lower
edge and curve the bottom of the fire chamber
up to it. Or you may elevate the entire bottom
of the fireplace. It is smart to plan the hearth
flush with the floor so that trash may be swept
into the fireplace without using a dustpan.</p>
<p>Rough native stone, of course, is the most
interesting material for a cabin fireplace and
chimney. Brick seems too refined for the woods.
If you want the finished job to look as massive
in appearance as possible, don&rsquo;t use stones that
are too small.</p>
<p>The walls of a stone fireplace and chimney
should be at least one foot thick. But as a concession
to safety, the entire fire box&mdash;back,
sides and floor&mdash;should be lined with good
quality firebrick. The
space between the
stone shell and firebrick
lining is filled with concrete.
Since the back
and sides of the interior
must reflect the heat into
the room, the back must
be slanted forward as it
rises, running up
straight about one-third
of the height of the
opening from the hearth
floor and then slanting
toward the front at an
angle of from 23 to 30
degrees. The sides
should slope inward,
<span class="pb" id="Page_11">11</span>
as they approach the back at, roughly, an angle
of 60 degrees.</p>
<p>Regardless of whether the top of the fireplace
opening is flat or arched, you will need a strong
support at this point. The best is an iron bar
about one-half inch thick and two inches wide.
Extend it across the width of the opening and
set it firmly in the stonework at each side. Any
blacksmith can make this bar for you, and the
curve he puts in it will determine the arch of
the opening. A &ldquo;T&rdquo; bar, set with the tail of the
&ldquo;T&rdquo; upward, is even better, since it is stronger
and requires less iron.</p>
<p>Behind the bar build a wooden form extending
back several inches and sloped slightly upward.
Then lay a course of stone on top of the
iron and fill in between the stone and the form
with a rich mixture of concrete reinforced with
iron rods. This concrete should rise at such an
angle as to come flush with the edge of the
damper. The reinforcing rods should extend
the full width of the arch and tie into the stone
at the sides.</p>
<h3>Buy a Good Damper</h3>
<p>Since the fireplace is probably the most important
feature of your cabin, don&rsquo;t skimp on
materials. Buy the best dome-type damper that
you can afford. Some fireplace &ldquo;experts&rdquo; will
say this is nonsense, but don&rsquo;t let them fool you.
The damper is to a fireplace what a mainspring
is to a watch.</p>
<p>The dome damper is set on top of the fire
brick lining where the throat enters the smoke
chamber. The handle to control it may be set
in the front or side as you wish (make sure of
this when you buy it) and may project or be
set in a recess in the masonry.</p>
<p>The throat, as can be seen in <a href="#fig6">Fig. 6</a>, is considerably
narrower from front to rear than the
fire box&mdash;5&frac12; inches is maximum&mdash;and
should come as near the front
as possible. It should begin 6 to 8
inches above the top of the fireplace
opening, extend the entire width of
the fire box and slant downward
toward the back. At the same time
the back surface of the fire box has
been slanting forward until it
reaches the same height at the beginning
of the throat. At this point
construct the smoke shelf, which is
literally a shelf set back to the vertical
line of your masonry.</p>
<div class="img" id="imgx5">
<img src="images/p06d.jpg" alt="" width="438" height="593" />
<p class="pcap">An arch like this helps
prevent downdraft.</p>
</div>
<dl class="undent pcap"><dt>DIRECTION OF PREVAILING WIND</dt>
<dt>CHIMNEY CAP</dt></dl>
<p>Proper construction of the smoke
chamber is often the factor that determines
the success of your fireplace. The amount of
taper may vary, but it is a good general rule to
slope the walls inward one foot for every 18
inches of height. The smoke chamber walls
must be as smooth as possible, the best finish
being about &frac12; inch of mortar&mdash;or a commercial
steel unit. This cuts down the amount of
friction and makes it draw better. After the
smoke chamber walls are tapered up to the
desired dimensions, the flue is straight from
here on up.</p>
<h3>Use Special Mortar</h3>
<p>Government specifications for fireplace mortar,
which must be used in laying all work except
the fire brick, are as follows: hydrated
lime, nine pounds to each 94-lb. bag of Portland
cement; mix this with three times its volume
of clean sand and enough water to make
a smooth workable mortar. Wet all stones before
applying the mortar. <i>Don&rsquo;t use ordinary</i>
lime mortar for fireplaces and chimneys.</p>
<p>Construction of the flue is the next important
matter. The flue is installed as the chimney is
built and must be planned with a fairly close
relationship to the fireplace itself. Fireplace
experts estimate that the correct ratio is 14 to 16
square inches of flue area to each square foot
of fireplace opening.</p>
<p>A round flue is the most satisfactory type. It
offers less friction and is easier to clean. Square
or oblong flues should be slightly larger than
if a round one is used. The easiest method&mdash;and
one that assures a tight flue&mdash;is to use fire
clay flue lining, filling in between it and the
stone shell with cement. Be sure that the flue is
as straight as possible and uniform in size right
up to the top. Don&rsquo;t taper it. If turns must be
made in it, make them gradual&mdash;never greater
than an angle of 45 degrees.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t try to use one flue for fireplace
and kitchen stove or another
fireplace. Make separate flues for
each. They may go up the same
chimney but the two or more flues
should be separated by at least four
inches of solid brick or concrete
unless tile flue linings are used.
When you have reached the top,
test the flue for leaks by lighting a
fire and covering the top of the
chimney. Escaping smoke will
reveal any leaks, which must be
repaired at once.</p>

<p>Location of your house will affect the action
of the chimney, since large objects such as trees
or a hill nearby will cause a down draught. If
this trouble is encountered, it may be corrected
by building an arch over the chimney cap. The
arch should be placed at right angles to the
cause of the down draught.</p>
<p>The chimney cap itself, which is an important
feature affecting the air currents that pull
the smoke out, should be about 12 inches high.
It can be made of cement and stone chips,
modeled by hand. Reinforcing rods or wire
mesh may be added if desired. The sides of
the cap should curve from the outside edge of
the masonry proper to the top of the cap.</p>
<p>A good type of flashing, which must be installed
to prevent leaks between the chimney
and the roof, is made of sheet lead, which is
everlasting. Galvanized iron or copper is also
satisfactory. The flashing should be cut to fit
the chimney like a collar and is imbedded in
the masonry. The roofing should overlap the
upper edge several inches, and the flashing must
overlap the roofing at the lower edge if set on
a slanting roof. In case the chimney comes at
the ridge, flashings are fastened over the roofing
all around.</p>
<p>While you&rsquo;re up on the roof finishing the
chimney, it would be a good idea to take the
measurements of the entire top. In your leisure
time, make a fairly tight cover, shaped like a
shallow box, that will fit on top of the chimney
when you close the cabin for the season. It can
be lashed down with wire or rope. The object
of this will be well known to anyone who has
left a cabin chimney open for several months,
because it seems to have a great attraction for
birds and squirrels&mdash;not to mention the fact
that snow and rain get in and rust the flue
lining if it&rsquo;s made of metal.</p>
<p>In planning your cabin fireplace don&rsquo;t fail at
least to investigate the several so-called &ldquo;patented&rdquo;
fireplace forms which circulate heated
air. (See <a href="#imgx6">illustrations</a>.) These are especially
worth considering if you expect to rely upon
your fireplace for heating the cabin during the
colder months, and also greatly simplify the
intricate job of fashioning a fireplace.</p>
<p>When using these forms the fireplace is constructed
with an air chamber behind the fire
box. Cold air is drawn off the floor and circulated
back in the room as warm air. This gives
you both direct radiated heat and warm air
from absorbed heat. Various installations are
possible, with the added heat being used in an
adjoining room&mdash;or even upstairs.</p>

<div class="img">
<img src="images/p07c.jpg" id="ncfig6" alt="BUILDING THE LOG CABIN" width="500" height="111" />
</div>
<p>Mention of a &ldquo;cabin in the woods&rdquo; brings a
vision to the average man of one thing&mdash;a
<i>log</i> cabin. And, although few people will ever
build a real log cabin, most of us have inherited
from our pioneer ancestors a romantic attachment
to the sturdily constructed homes of our
early settlers. The pioneers built of logs primarily
because they had no other materials and
also because they needed a shelter that would
be a protection against Indians, wild animals
and rough weather.</p>
<p>But just because a cabin is built of rough
logs instead of finished lumber doesn&rsquo;t mean
that it will be less expensive in this day and age.
According to such experts as C. D. Aldrich,
who designs some of the finest cabins in the
country, a log cabin costs about twice as much
as a frame cottage of comparable size and design.
A one-room-and-porch cabin that can be
built of lumber for about $500 would cost
roughly $1,000 if well built of logs.</p>
<p>There are two styles of log cabin construction&mdash;the
traditional kind with the logs laid
horizontally and the stockade type in which the
logs or half logs are placed upright. The latter
is easier to build since skilled axe work is not
required to notch the log ends and the principal
task is to hew down the sides to make them
fit closely. On the other hand, a cabin built with
horizontal logs is the favorite with most people&mdash;probably
because it is the most familiar.</p>
<p>Logs for a stockade style cabin need not be
particularly heavy since they are to be spiked
to the horizontal members of a timber frame,
but care should be taken to obtain pieces as
straight as possible to avoid waste. Second
growth timber is most frequently used. Chinks
between the timbers are caulked with oakum,
or, if the fit is very loose, combine oakum with
willow wands or narrow battens. However,
most people building a recreational home of
logs will want the horizontal type of construction,
so this chapter will be devoted to that subject.</p>
<p>One of the first things to decide after the
rough plans are drawn and the list of materials
estimated is whether the cabin is to be of peeled
logs or logs with the bark left on. Logs that are
to keep their bark must be cut in late October
or November and stacked on skids until spring.
Be sure they are piled so that plenty of air
circulates. Logs to be peeled should also be cut
in fall or winter and seasoned&mdash;preferably for
six months or more. To prevent cracks when
they begin to weather, have the logs scored
down one side&mdash;a two or three inch strip of
bark removed the entire length. Then if the logs
crack a bit, they will do so along the scored
lines and they can be laid so the cracks won&rsquo;t
show in the finished building.</p>
<p>The size of your cabin, or rather the dimensions
of the various walls, is not necessarily
limited by the length of the logs, because they
can be spliced. (See <a href="#fig7">Fig. 7</a> for the best
method of splicing.) If you are counting on
leaving a projection at each end beyond the
wall, then you can figure that logs 20 feet long
will give you a room with inside walls about
16 feet long. Logs between 20 and 30 feet long
are most satisfactory unless you have a large
crew to help. They should average about 10
inches at the top end with as little taper as possible.
If you get smaller logs, it will require too
many to gain the needed height, and logs much
larger than that are unwieldy to handle.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig7">
<img src="images/p07d.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="168" />
<p class="pcap">Fig. 7. How to splice logs.</p>
</div>
<p>The best timber for a log cabin on the Pacific
Coast is redwood or western cedar. Balsam,
hemlock, pine, and, if you are lucky, tamarack
also make good logs. The latter are especially
fine. You may buy your logs from a lumber
company, from a public utility company&rsquo;s supply
of power-line poles, or you can hire a good
woodsman to cut them for you&mdash;if you can find
the timber. Certain sections of the National
<span class="pb" id="Page_14">14</span>
Forests are available for cutting logs and
stumpage charge is very nominal.</p>
<p>There are several possible methods of fitting
logs together. The choice depends entirely on
how much time and labor you care to devote
to it, but once a style has been adopted carry it
throughout the whole house. Use similar logs
or poles instead of dressed lumber wherever
possible. They&rsquo;re more &ldquo;woodsy.&rdquo; Speaking of
style, all log ends that project should be finished
off with an axe, not sawed.</p>
<p>After the sill logs are laid on the leveled
boulder foundation, or in the case of a concrete
or stone wall underpinning bolted to the foundation,
the next step is to lay the floor joists.
They should be not less than 2&times;6 material,
spaced not over two feet on center. Notch them
into the sill log and the first log above as shown
in <a href="#fig8">Fig. 8</a> and spike them in.</p>
<h3>Use Spirit Level Frequently</h3>
<p>You are now ready to start erection of the
walls. Make frequent and careful use of the
plumb line and spirit level in this work. Without
constant checking the walls have a way of
going off at odd tangents.</p>
<p>The simplest and least difficult style of fitting
logs is the &ldquo;saddle and notch,&rdquo; in which the
logs are given a rough notch and laid together
without special fitting or trimming. The spaces
are later caulked with oakum. While this is
the simplest method, it is the poorest from the
standpoint of weather tightness.</p>
<div class="img" id="imgx8">
<img src="images/p08.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="544" />
<p class="pcap">Four methods of notching logs.</p>
</div>
<p>Another and better method is the same as
above except that the notches are so carefully
cut that the logs fit closely and must be hewn
down along two sides to provide neatly joined
surfaces. This also will require some caulking
but not as much. It is customary to lay a strip
of oakum between all logs, regardless of the
style of fitting.</p>
<h3>Cupped Logs Fit Snugly</h3>
<p>A third method is to use &ldquo;cupped&rdquo; logs. The
same saddle and notch is used at the corners,
but the upper log has a concaved channel cut
its entire length, which makes it fit down snugly
over the lower log. The cup may be cut with
curved-blade adz or with a heavy gouge. This is
more work but well worth it. Cut each cup to fit
its individual lower log, marking the cup with
a pair of dividers to insure a close fit. When you
have a perfect cup (which means rolling the
log into position several times to try its fit) lay
a layer of heavy oakum along the lower log,
roll the upper into its final position and spike
it down.</p>
<p>The finest method of all is a further refinement
of the cupped log style. The upper log is
cupped as above but, instead of a simple notch
at the end, the upper log is cut out exactly to
fit down over the lower tightly, while the lower
is not notched at all. Oakum is strung the same
as for other methods and laid in at the corners.
In the best work of this type no oakum should
show. Although the pioneers put their cabins
together without nails, they did so because
they had no nails to use. To be
safe, spike all logs together with 12-inch
spikes&mdash;the largest size made.</p>
<p>Before you get the walls too high, give
a thought to windows and doors.
There are two ways of taking care of
them. The extravagant way, much used
by our forefathers, was to build with
logs to the top line of the proposed opening
and then cut out a hole the required
size. An easier&mdash;and
<span class="pb" id="Page_15">15</span>
less wasteful&mdash;way, if you are doing your own
work, is to use short logs, leaving a more or
less rectangular opening. Then nail a couple
of straight boards where your frames should
come and saw off the rough projecting log
ends as illustrated above.</p>
<div class="img" id="imgx9">
<img src="images/p08d.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="457" />
<p class="pcap"><span class="ssn">PLANKS NAILED AS GUIDE FOR CUTTING</span></p>
</div>
<dl class="undent pcap"><dt>LOWER LOG HEWN OUT</dt></dl>
<p>Incidentally, in planning your house remember
to take into consideration that a log cabin&rsquo;s
interior absorbs a great deal of the light unless&mdash;God
forbid&mdash;you intend to whitewash the
walls. Therefore, plan for as many windows as
your walls will allow without unduly weakening
them or disrupting your interior plans.</p>
<p>Use timber at least two inches thick for window
and door frames and wide enough to protrude
slightly on the outside of the log wall.
The bottom piece&mdash;or sill&mdash;of the window
frames should have a pitch of about one inch to
the outside and project two inches to allow for
drainage of rainwater. Don&rsquo;t try to build your
own windows. Order them to size from a mill
and set them in.</p>
<h3>Roof Should be Sturdy</h3>
<p>The pitch of the roof and the width of the
eaves are largely matters of personal taste and
the kind of cabin you are building. A low
pitched or flat roof, however, must be thoroughly
braced if it is to bear a heavy load of snow,
and the additional materials may cost more
than a steeply pitched roof. The most effective
roof for many cabins is low pitched with wide
eaves&mdash;not too wide, of course, but wider than
you&rsquo;d have on a city house. Build the gable ends
to the height you finally decide on; then trim
down the rough ends along a line marked to the
pitch of the roof.</p>
<p>If you have been wise, you have a long,
straight log of unquestioned strength saved for
your ridge pole. This should rest in notches at
the very peak of the gables, and since it forms
the keystone of your house, be sure it is solid
and well bedded in oakum. The auxiliary roof
supports, called purlins, run parallel to the
ridge log and should be set by notching out the
gable log where the purlin end rests. Cope the
log above it so that the two gable logs grip the
purlin firmly. These purlins ought to project
eight or ten inches beyond the roof itself to allow
for axe-trimmed ends. (<a href="#fig9">Fig. 9</a>.)</p>
<h3>Smaller Logs for Rafters</h3>
<p>Rafters are the next problem. Choose smaller
timbers, yet ones that are well proportioned to
the purlins. For the average cabin, logs with
four-inch butts are about right. They should be
spaced not more than two feet on the centers.
Saw a square cut into the plate log&mdash;the top
logs of your walls&mdash;then square a place on
your rafter to fit into this cut. Drive it well
home. (<a href="#fig9">Fig. 9</a>.)</p>

<p>Each rafter should be cut in slightly to the
purlins and spiked tightly to each purlin and
to the ridge log. When setting in any of these
pieces don&rsquo;t forget to bed them well with oakum
to make sure that they are weather tight.

Dressed siding is good material for the roof.
On this nail the roofing you have selected.</p>
<p>The type of roofing used depends on how
much you want to spend. Composition roofing
is fire resistant and will last quite well, but it is
not particularly attractive on a log cabin.
Shingles laid in the customary way with the
butt ends exposed for about one-third of the
length make a good roof. Shakes probably
make the most interesting as well as durable
roofs for a cabin, although they are more expensive.
Shakes come in various sizes and add
a final distinctive touch to a house.</p>
<p>If you expect to use your cabin in very cold
weather, a double roof would be the wise provision.
After laying your sheathing, cover it
with a layer of building paper or other insulating
material. Then nail on a series of 2&times;2 timber
strips parallel to the rafters beneath. Across
these strips lay another layer of sheathing and
then the shingles or shakes. This forms a dead
air space that is effective in insulating the house
against cold.</p>
<h3>Use Planks for Cabin Doors</h3>
<p>If you are going to keep the pioneer atmosphere
in your log cabin, don&rsquo;t spoil it by buying
millwork doors. Good, honest plank doors&mdash;made
of any dressed timber, with cross pieces
firmly nailed and clinched&mdash;are more in the
spirit of things. A little ingenuity will go a long
way toward making a beautiful door out of
humble materials. Have some country blacksmith
make a set of strap hinges and an old
fashioned latch. You&rsquo;ll be well pleased with
the effect. A good, strong snap lock is a necessity
to keep out intruders in your absence, of
course.</p>
<p>If you want a good floor with a cabin &ldquo;look&rdquo;
to it, get a supply of planks in widths varying
from 6 to 12 inches&mdash;and have them tongue-and-grooved
at the mill. Instead of nailing
them, bore &frac34;-inch
holes half way
through and fasten
them down with
screws. Into each
hole drive a hardwood
plug, gluing it
for tightness; then
cut it off and smooth
it down flush with
the floor with sandpaper. This
gives the
effect of a &ldquo;pinned&rdquo;
floor, which was
very popular with the pioneer cabin builders.</p>
<p>Tongue-and-grooved flooring in narrow
widths should be &ldquo;blind-nailed&rdquo;&mdash;the nails
driven in at a slant from the sides and set with
a punch, but for wide planks it is perfectly all
right, if you wish, to nail through the boards
and let the heads show.</p>
<h3>How to Prevent Pests</h3>
<p>Log cabins, particularly those where the bark
is left on, fall heir to many evils in the form
of borers and beetles that make their homes in
the bark. Winter-cut logs are less likely to have
borers than others, and if they are to be peeled,
peeling should be done in the spring before the
first flight of the beetles. Cedar and redwood
are almost entirely free from borers. Peeled
logs are not likely to attract boring pests, but
they may be the home of larvae previously laid
there.</p>
<p>If you do not care if your logs are stained,
they may be painted with a solution of liquid
oil coal-tar creosote. This stains the bark a dark
brown, if used straight, but diluted with three
parts kerosene it stains only slightly. The odor
is rather unpleasant, but if the treating is done
several months before the logs are used, it will
wear off.</p>
<p>Pyridine, a colorless liquid, is one of the
best pest killers. It also has a strong, unpleasant
odor. It should be applied on a windy day
and in the open air. It burns the skin slightly,
so be careful. Also, it is highly inflammable.</p>
<p>Paradichlorobenzene is a very effective control
but is not permanent in effect. It will, however,
rid your logs of existing pests by slowly
liberating a gas which kills the insects. Dissolve
three parts, by weight, in a gallon of kerosene
and apply either with a spray gun or a
brush. Small logs may be dipped in a trough
filled with the solution.
Two gallons
will saturate about
100 square feet of
wood surface.</p>
<p>For logs that are
to retain their bark,
it is also well to
paint all cut places
and knots with crude
creosote soon after
cutting and again before
use.</p>

<div class="img">
<img src="images/p09a.jpg" id="ncfig7" alt="BUILDING A CABIN OF STONE" width="500" height="100" />
</div>
<p>Next to a log cabin one of the most effective
in appearance is one built of stone&mdash;rough
field stones and boulders that can be picked up
on the shore of any lake or stream. Naturally,
such a house is a pretty big task for an amateur
builder&mdash;not that it requires much more technical
knowledge but because stones have a way
of getting pretty heavy when they have to be
lifted 8 or 10 feet off the ground. However, the
result is well worth the effort.</p>
<p>If you are ambitious enough to want to build
a stone cabin, here are some simple directions
about how to do it. They are the result of actual
experience but, of course, cannot be taken as a
practical course in masonry.</p>
<p>The first step is like the old recipe for rabbit
stew&mdash;you get some rocks and a load or two of
aggregate, clean sand and numerous sacks of
cement. (Tell the cement dealer what you plan
to do and he&rsquo;ll advise how much of each you&rsquo;ll
need.) You&rsquo;ll also need a quantity of rough
lumber, 2&times;4&rsquo;s, 1&times;6&rsquo;s, and such, for the framework
and a more or less water-tight mortar boat
in which to mix your mortar.</p>
<p>A cabin of stone requires a full concrete or
rock foundation. The walls will be extra heavy,
so the footings as well as the foundation walls
should be proportionately wider and thicker
than those described for log and frame cabins.</p>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p09b.jpg" id="ncfig8" alt="FOUNDATION" width="500" height="539" />
</div>
<dl class="undent pcap"><dt>MORTAR FILL</dt>
<dt>SMOOTH FORM OF PLANKS <span class="sc">OR</span> PLYWOOD</dt>
<dt>MORTAR</dt>
<dt>FOUNDATION</dt></dl>
<p>After the foundation is poured, erect a frame
for your house to the height of your roof plate
on the inner side of the foundation walls, putting
rough boarding on the outside of 2&times;4
studs. This will give you something to work
against to insure plumb walls.</p>
<p>Stone walls should be at least one and one-half
feet thick at the bottom (remember this in
building the foundation) and taper to eight
inches or so at the top. The larger rocks, of
course, should be used lower down, although,
if the work is carefully done, an occasional
large one may be set in higher up to lend effect.</p>
<h3>Mix Mortar Thoroughly</h3>
<p>Start the first course of stones about three
inches from the board form and fill in the space
between with mortar. The correct mixture for
this mortar is six parts of clean sand to one part
of cement. After a little experimentation you
will find the correct consistency, but be sure
that it is well mixed. As one expert says, &ldquo;Mix
the stuff with your hoe until your back is broken
and then mix it some more.&rdquo; Wet the stones
thoroughly before setting in the mortar.</p>
<p>The end of each stone should be firmly
bedded in the mortar, and as soon as several
courses of rock have been laid, tamp the mortar
well down. Small pieces of rock may be pushed
into the mortar if you wish to make it go farther.</p>
<p>When you build your wooden form, of course
you put up the door and window frames. They
can&rsquo;t be cut out of the walls afterward as with
a log cabin. Drive numerous long spikes into
the outer surfaces of these frames. This gives
you something to &ldquo;tie&rdquo; to when you reach that
height with your masonry.</p>
<p>Building a stone house is slow work, and
since you&rsquo;ll have to leave your work at times,
remember that all mortar that has been laid the
day before must be thoroughly wet before fresh
mortal is applied on top of it. And the entire
walls ought to be wet down at least twice daily
for a week or more after completion.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_18">18</div>
<p>When you have reached the top course of
stones, set in a row of threaded iron bolts two
feet apart and long enough to allow three inches
of the threaded end to stick up. On these you
must bolt 2&times;4&rsquo;s, so that you have something to
nail the rafters to.</p>
<div class="img" id="imgx10">
<img src="images/p10.jpg" alt="" width="491" height="409" />
<p class="pcap">Window and door frames are set
into the masonry as it proceeds,
with long spikes protruding to
&ldquo;tie&rdquo; them firmly.</p>
</div>
<dl class="undent pcap"><dt>2&Prime;&times;6&Prime; WINDOW FRAME</dt>
<dt>SPIKES TIE FRAME TO MASONRY</dt></dl>
<p>When the walls have set, remove the interior
wooden forms and go over the inside walls to
fill up any air holes. These are not important
unless they are too large. The rest of the job
is done just as in finishing any other house.
You&rsquo;ll probably want to cover the interior with
some material, because concrete is pretty cold
and might remind someone of the time he was
arrested for speeding.</p>
<p>The cost of a stone house depends on the
amount of material you can find lying around
the neighborhood and the cost of labor. Some
stone cabins, with most of the labor hired, have
been built for approximately $2.50 per square
foot of floor space. This includes labor, materials,
built-ins, electrical wiring and fixtures,
and plastered walls. If you find it necessary to
hire skilled stone masons or to transport your
material considerable distance, the cost will be
higher. You can, of course, lower it by doing
a larger amount of the work yourself.</p>
<p>Remember that stone work is slow work, so
allow yourself plenty of time. The first course
or so of stone will drop into place pretty fast,
but don&rsquo;t forget that Rome was not built in a
day&mdash;and Rome was built of stone.</p>
<p>For making colored concrete, for floors,
hearths, etc., a topping containing the color is
put on over the previously-poured base. This
topping consists of <i>five gallons</i> of water per
sack of cement, <i>one</i> cubic foot of sand and 1&frac12;
cubic feet of coarse aggregate. You may use
factory-colored cement, or mix it on the job by
passing the dry cement and coloring matter
through a screen with a &#8539;-inch mesh until well
mixed.</p>
<p>An excellent treatment for colored concrete
is to rub the surface thoroughly with equal parts
of paraffin oil and benzine. This closes the pores
and brings out the color uniformly.</p>
<p>In considering such permanent types of construction
as stone, the great advantage of concrete
should not be overlooked. Walls of this
material are poured between wood, plywood
or metal forms in the manner previously described
for foundation walls.</p>
<p>Perhaps you object because the finished
structure would not be &ldquo;in keeping&rdquo; with a
woods atmosphere. But one method is possible
whereby a facing of natural stone backed by
poured concrete combines the advantages of
concrete with a stone house &ldquo;look.&rdquo; This is
called a Flagg Masonry Wall after its originator,
Ernest Flagg, New York architect. The
illustration shows the method of pouring such
a wall.</p>
<p>For a beach house the smooth, modern lines
of the concrete walls are quite appropriate for
the clean, clear atmosphere of a beach site.</p>
<p>Concrete is fireproof, termite proof, requires
little or no maintenance, and is not subject to
decay. In a house that is often not in use, like
a beach or mountain retreat, the value of a material
of these characteristics is obvious.</p>

</div>
<p>Frame-type cabins present no structural
problems that are unfamiliar to anyone who
knows the fundamentals of ordinary frame
house construction. The essential details of
building almost any sort of simple frame house
are the same, the main difference being in your
choice of exterior finish.</p>
<p>If your vacation home is a beach house, you
may even find the regular type of stucco finish
appropriate for your particular location. Or
you may want to combine stucco finish with
wood siding or with board and batten. The
main objective is to keep the structure in harmony
with its surroundings.</p>
<p>This is particularly true of simple cabins in
the mountains. A brick bungalow, for example,
would be splendid for warmth and strength for
a hunting lodge, but it would be wholly out of
place in the forest, as would ordinary concrete
finish, stucco, or certain types of frame houses.</p>
<p>There are a number of western lumber companies
that specialize in manufacturing novel
types of siding designed primarily for cabins
and other buildings with a forest background.
Some of these cost only a little more than ordinary
lumber and make a very attractive cabin.</p>
<p>Among the novelty sidings, you may buy
rounded siding that gives the effect of smoothly
finished half-logs, or &ldquo;hewn&rdquo; timbers that
look exactly like hand-hewn logs. You can even
get special end pieces which, when carefully
attached, give the effect of projecting log ends.
As you can see from the illustrations, this novelty
siding can be applied by anyone who knows
how to use a set of carpenter&rsquo;s tools.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig10">
<img src="images/p10e.jpg" alt="" width="457" height="295" />
<p class="pcap">This is the proper way to apply
half-round siding to the studs. The
log ends add a very realistic touch.</p>
</div>
<p>If you are planning to build a frame cottage
or summer home, the field of design is, of
course, limited largely by the amount of money
you have to spend. If you are not an old hand
at carpentering it would be well to get the assistance
of a builder or a lumber company in
selecting your materials. A man with a knowledge
of building can keep you from making
mistakes that might not be discovered until the
house was built.</p>
<p>One of the easiest and most effective cabins
is built with a &ldquo;board and batten&rdquo; exterior. This
consists of broad planks ... their width is a
matter of your own judgment ... applied either
horizontally or vertically. Between each pair of
planks runs a strip of batten which may be
nailed flat over the seam or, if you get the specially
milled battens, there is a groove into
which the wide boards fit. A combination of
board and batten and stone construction makes
an exceptionally attractive exterior if you use
some artistic judgment in combining the two.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig11">
<img src="images/p10f.jpg" alt="" width="508" height="516" />
<p class="pcap">This is the effect obtained by use of
hewn siding. It is applied like any
other lumber, with extra end pieces
to give illusion of a real log cabin.</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_20">20</div>
<p>If you are planning to use the house in the
cold months, it is well to insulate the walls at
least with heavy building paper. In very cold
climates it is best to finish the walls on both the
exterior and the interior, filling the spaces between
the studs with one of the commercial
insulating &ldquo;wools,&rdquo; made of wood fibre or
asbestos. If you must save money, you can buy
sawdust at the local mill and pack it in.</p>
<p>Hand-split shakes also make an attractive
cabin finish. The rough pioneer effect of the
crude shakes is quite in keeping with the wilderness
atmosphere. These are applied in much
the same manner as ordinary shingles.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig12">
<img src="images/p11.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="434" />

<p>If you undertake the construction of a frame
cabin without the assistance of an experienced
carpenter or builder, you should keep in mind
the minimum requirements set up by the Forest
Service as standard specifications for cabins to
be built in deep snow country:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>All girders should be not
less than 4&times;4 material spaced
not more than 7 feet on
centers.</p>
<p>All main posts supporting
building should be not less
than 4&times;4, spaced not more
than 7 feet apart in any
direction and should rest on
rock or concrete base; this
applies to open porches also.</p>
<p>All floor joists (including
those under open porches)
should be not less than 2&times;6
material, spaced not over
2 feet on center.</p>
<p>Studding in sidewalls,
where siding runs vertically,
should be spaced not more
than 6 feet on center and
should be not less than 2&times;4
material. At least one 2&times;4
should be placed around the
building, horizontally, between
the floor plate and
ceiling plate, and the side
boards should be securely
nailed to this horizontal ribbon
as well as the top and
bottom plates.</p>
<p>On buildings where siding
runs horizontally, studding
should be placed not over
2 feet on center on outside walls and be not less than
2&times;4 material.</p>
<p>Double headers and proper bridging should be installed
over all openings in outside walls. This is not
necessary in partitions.</p>
<p>Rafters should be spaced not more than 2 feet on
center and should be not less than 2&times;4 material on all
spans up to 16 feet. All spans of more than 16 feet
should use rafters of not less than 2&times;6 material and
be spaced not more than 2 feet on center. Rafters and
other members of the roof frame should be of selected,
straight-grain lumber.</p>
<p>All ceiling joists should be good, straight-grained
sticks not less than 2&times;4 material and spaced not more
than 2 feet on center. Nail them securely to both
rafters and plate. All buildings with a gable roof
should contain ceiling joists. All spans of more than
14 feet should have collar beams to support the rafters.</p>

<p>The ideal mountain cabin should be almost
a part of the rugged landscape that surrounds
it, with rough walls and stout roof that
seem to hug the rocks. The very majesty and
sweep of the hills dwarf any attempt by man
to build himself a tall, imposing mountain
home&mdash;it is better to build for simplicity and
strength.</p>
<p>In this &ldquo;cabin in the clouds,&rdquo; resembling
some of the mountaineers&rsquo; huts in the Alps,
every effort has been made to keep the atmosphere
as rustic and as rugged as possible, at the
same time providing all the conveniences of a
comfortable modern home.</p>
<p>The walls, the designer says, should be of
stone, 16 inches thick. The roof should be of
redwood shakes or slates, but remember that
any roofing must stand storms and very high
winds in the mountains. The railing of the car
shelter is of stone, also, with roof supports of
heavy hewn redwood timbers.</p>
<p>The living room centers around the massive
fireplace, which should be of rough stone. It is
flanked on one side by a built-in seat, and a
wood box on the other, with an outside door.
Walls should be finished in rough plaster or
wood panelling, with ceiling beams exposed.
All floors are of wood except the terrace, which
is flagstones.</p>
<p>On the front a broad window overlooks the
terrace and, presumably, a sweeping view of a
valley. A big sliding door of glass opens on the
terrace also.</p>
<p>Opposite the fireplace is space for two built-in
bunks in an alcove, enclosed by a curtain
hung from a ceiling track. The bunk room
proper, with a dressing closet and clothes
closet, contains two double-deck bunks.</p>
<p>The kitchen may seem a bit small, but it is
larger than many found in modern city apartments,
and much more convenient.</p>

<p>A broad beach, with lots of fine white sand,
would be the ideal location for this ultra-modern
beach house, with its clean, sweeping
lines. As in the case of many of the new houses,
there is a generous use of glass. In the outside
walls are shown 22 windows, which should
satisfy any fresh air addict.</p>
<p>Construction of this streamlined beach house
calls for a concrete substructure and first floor
with wood frame above. To insure a cool house,
the most satisfying exterior would be dazzling
white stucco, which is an excellent heat reflector.
The floors should be of concrete flagstones
or tiles, tinted and waxed.</p>
<p>The sun deck is a welcome feature on any
beach house, because there are days when the
ocean breezes are cool, and one may bask here
behind the protection of glass screens.</p>
<p>Inside, the plan calls for a single room with
high ceiling, and a series of sliding curtains
which cut off the bunk room and a dining
alcove if desired. There is a separate bunk
room for guests. If double-deck bunks are used,
eight persons may occupy the house.</p>
<p>The bathroom has the added convenience of
an extra toilet, or the space may be used for
another closet. As in all well-planned beach
houses, there is an extra shower just inside the
entry from the beach.</p>
<p>The whole interior may be done in plywood
panels, either natural color or painted in a
light-colored eggshell finish.</p>
<p>The broad open spaces beneath the house
serve several purposes. They offer ample storage
for beach umbrellas, chairs, ping-pong
table and such, as well as a dressing room for
bathers. By careful planning beforehand, a
dumb-waiter could be installed to connect the
kitchen with the beach, thus saving many steps
when serving a barbecue meal or a cold snack
on the sand. It will be noted that the fireplace
chimney base has been utilized as a beach barbecue,
so that food may be prepared without
going up to the main kitchen.</p>

posts form the frame, with 3&times;4 rafters running
to an octagonal block at the peak. Two 6&times;8
timbers support the second floor.</p>
<p>Tiny as it seems, this
lodge offers a maximum of
room for lovers of snow
sports. The height is 14 feet
from floor to peak.</p>
<p>Most unusual of its features
is the door in the roof.
At first glance this might
seem odd, but the first time
the main door is buried under ten feet of snow,
you&rsquo;ll be glad the roof door was put in.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a fireplace on the ground floor, of
course, and all the conveniences for a week-end
stay. However, in such limited space as much of
the furniture as possible should be of the folding
type. It will be noted that no provision was
made for bath or toilet. These features would
have to be in a detached structure, which is preferable
to addition of a side room, which would
spoil the unique shape of the house.</p>
<p>A number of cabins of this type have been
built on the Pacific coast in recent years. One of
the first, and probably the original one, was
constructed by Fred B. Stephen, Seattle architect,
for his family&rsquo;s use on a site in the Cascade
mountains, 85 miles from Seattle.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s a good answer to
the problem of a low-cost
club house for a hiking
or snow-sports group.
Since much of the work on
such a cabin might be done
by the members, construction
is as simple as possible.
The exterior may be
anything from rough
tongue-and-grooved
boards, the cheapest, to
real logs, the most expensive.
Interior walls are
sheathed with plywood,
stained or painted, and the
roof covered with composition roofing. The long
bunk room, partitioned off for privacy, holds
nine double-deck bunks, and has separate bathrooms
adjoining for men and women. A stove
should be included in this room, for extra
warmth.</p>
<p>One may drive to the front door, unload passengers
or supplies, and proceed to a stall in the
car shelter conveniently. The kitchen is just inside
the front door, making trips through or
around the house with supplies unnecessary.</p>
<p>The living room, spacious enough to seat
twenty for meals, contains two built-in bunks.
Off it is a tack room for storing skis and other
equipment, which can also be used as a work
shop. A large dining table might be used for
ping-pong and other games. Both the woodbox
by the fireplace and in the bunkroom may be
stocked from the outside, a great convenience in
winter when fires burn constantly.</p>
<p>Note that the car shelter has space for six
machines.</p>

<p>Just because a summer cabin is small and inexpensive
is no reason why it cannot be
smart and distinctive in appearance. The little
house shown here could probably be built for
less than $1000, yet it has many features worthy
of a vacation home costing many times that.</p>
<p>Construction is entirely of wood, in a fashion
reminiscent of Japanese houses, with wide doors
and a broad, low roof. The easiest and most
pleasing finish, both outside and inside would
be plywood. The waterproof variety is durable
and not costly, and it is so easy to apply that any
amateur can turn out a pleasing job. Plywood
is adaptable to any of the regulation wood-finish
treatments from oiling or staining to painting,
and will last indefinitely.</p>
<p>The roof would be attractive if covered with
a brightly colored composition roofing, or with
stained shingles or shakes.</p>
<p>The house consists of one large room, with
alcoves for dining and sleeping. The Pullman-type
kitchen, which means that everything is
compact and within easy reach, connects both
with the dining area and the barbecue patio at
the rear of the house&mdash;a convenience if meals
are to be served outside.</p>
<p>The same thoughtfulness has gone into planning
of the bath. It has one door into the bunk-alcove
and another opening on the pier, so that
swimmers may go to the shower without tracking
up the rest of the house.</p>
<p>A curtain shuts off the bunk alcove at night,
and pulls back to make this part of the main
room by day. Two double bunks provide beds
for four persons.</p>
<p>Large folding doors at each end of the house
open on the pier and the patio, giving an unusual
sense of roominess.</p>
<p>The fireplace arrangement is also quite unusual,
having a single chimney which serves
three purposes. It carries flues from the fireplace,
the kitchen stove and the barbecue grill
in the patio. The woodbox is just inside the
door for convenient filling.</p>

<p>One of the principal
drawbacks to a real
log cabin is the amount
of work involved, as well
as the expense. On the
other hand, the cabin
shown here is an example
of what can be done
with &ldquo;imitation logs&rdquo;
that give the effect of real
ones, while the task of
building with them is no
more difficult than with
any finished lumber. In
another part of this book
will be found illustrations of the various ways
this log siding may be applied to obtain rustic
effects.</p>
<p>If this cabin is to be left unpainted, it would
be wise to apply a coat of silver stain. This
gives the illusion of weathering and does away
with the &ldquo;raw&rdquo; look of a new house. The roof,
of shakes, should be treated the same way.</p>
<p>To avoid cluttering up the living room, the
designer has provided a separate room for
bunks. This one holds two double-deckers and
a large clothes closet. A
short hall connects with
the bathroom. A really
novel feature is the pair
of small windows which
light the &ldquo;upper&rdquo; and
&ldquo;lower&rdquo; of each set of
bunks.</p>
<p>The kitchen is well
lighted with three windows
and a door, and has
ample space for roomy
cupboards and a work
table. The stove can be
placed so that the flue
connects with the fireplace chimney.</p>
<p>The living room is large enough to hold a
fairly large fireplace. It has windows on three
sides, in addition to a pair of French doors
opening on a rustic terrace.</p>
<p>One of the advantages of this kind of cabin
over a real log one, is the ease with which the
interior can be finished. Perhaps the most
suitable finish would be natural-color oiled
plywood panels. Knotty pine or redwood paneling
would also be attractive.</p>

</div>
<p>For the amateur builder
who wants to try his hand
at a cabin, this attractive design
presents a minimum of
construction problems and
calls for only a very modest
outlay for materials. At the
same time, if the work is well
done, this cabin can be made
as smart and attractive as one
costing twice as much.</p>
<p>The most satisfactory, as
well as the easiest way to
build this cabin, would be
with a frame of redwood timbers
covered with half-round
imitation log siding. Another finish that is not
difficult to work out is with a combination of
vertical and horizontal board and batten, running
the boards vertically for the walls and
horizontally at the gable ends.</p>
<p>Since this is first of all a rustic cabin, it
should by all means have a roof of redwood
shakes. The manner in which these are laid is
responsible for lending interest and claim to
an otherwise rather plain roof-line.</p>
<p>The front porch may be either flagstones or
heavy planks, although the latter would, of
course, call for a foundation. The two seats
make an inviting place to rest,
but as will be seen from an inspection
of the floor plan, they
serve for more than ordinary
seats. They have corresponding
seats inside the living room, and
beneath them are concealed two
roll-away double beds. Such
construction for the beds is a
great advantage in a small cabin,
since they can be pulled out or
put away as needed. This leaves
the whole living room, which is
12&frac12; &times; 20 feet, for any style of
decoration you like.</p>
<p>The fireplace parallels the 20-foot
dimensions of the room and may therefore
be fairly large. A general rule is to make it
one-third as wide as the longest dimension of
the room.</p>
<p>The kitchen is very conveniently arranged.
It has three windows, affording ample light. A
dinette, which could be made with a drop table
and folding seats if necessary, occupies one
side of the room. The stove can be placed so
that the flue can go up the fireplace chimney.</p>
<p>This plan was furnished through the courtesy
of the California Redwood Association.</p>

<p>Four walls, a roof and a
floor, will make a cabin
after a fashion. But a
glance at the illustration
above will show what a little
thought, care and imagination
on the part of a
good architect will do to
those same four walls.</p>
<p>This simple, inexpensive
country cottage, sleeping
four comfortably, has all
the little touches that distinguish
a house of real charm. Because of its
simplicity, this cabin is adaptable to almost
any site. The original was designed by Angelo
Hewetson, San Francisco architect, to fit between
four huge redwood trees, and to be in
keeping with the natural beauty of the location.</p>
<p>The exterior is of heavy sawed siding, although
board and batten would also be effective.
The roof, stained a rich brown, is of shingles
laid irregularly. The siding is stained pearl
gray, for a weathered effect, with trim to match,
and the doors are painted a soft rose. Inside,
this cabin is equally charming. The living room
is broad and comfortable,
and features a massive fireplace.
A &ldquo;waterback&rdquo; may
be installed in the back of
the fireplace, connected
with a storage boiler to furnish
hot water whenever
the fireplace is in use. At
other times a water heater,
burning liquid gas or oil,
would heat the same tank.</p>
<p>The interior finish used
by Mr. Hewetson is about
as attractive as can be devised, and it&rsquo;s inexpensive,
too. Walls and ceilings in the living
room and alcoves are sheathed in knotty pine
boards of random widths from 4 to 10 inches,
and the doors are all of planks of similar material.
All is stained driftwood gray with a
touch of rose for warmth. The kitchen and bath
are in cream with soft green trim.</p>
<p>The porch, open to the sky, offers an ideal
place for basking in the sun without shutting
off any light from the interior. In good weather
it can be used as a sleeping porch to accommodate
an extra guest.</p>

<p>Just at a glance, would you think it possible
for eleven persons to be accommodated in
the cabin illustrated here? It is only 20 &times; 28 feet
in inside area, yet such a feat is possible by intelligent
use of every bit of floor space. The real
secret lies in utilization of the loft formed by the
high roof. This is transformed into a balcony-bedroom,
with space enough for two double
beds and a single cot. Curtains or screens give
the necessary privacy. That takes care of five
persons.</p>
<p>Downstairs, the living room is furnished with
a long refectory table and benches, several easy
chairs and a day-bed that opens into a double
bed at night. That&rsquo;s two more. Then, in the alcove
off the living room, are two double-deck
bunks&mdash;and there&rsquo;s your accommodations for
a total of eleven!</p>
<p>As in the case of most of these cabins, this
one is adaptable to a number of exterior treatments.
Real logs or frame construction with
siding and boards and batten are indicated in
the drawing. The porches provide two more
suitable rooms, where meals may be served in
good weather.</p>
<p>John Rattray, of Marysville, built the original
of this cabin at Lake Madrone, Butte
County, California.</p>

<p>After the noise and confusion of city life,
what more enjoyable change could one
find than to spend a quiet week-end in a restful,
unpretentious cabin such as this? Because
it has such regular, unbroken walls,
it would be a fairly easy job to build out of
real logs, just as the designer has illustrated
it. In many parts of the West, the entire
structure could be erected from materials
provided by Nature right on the site.</p>
<p>Since this is intended for week-end use, it
is not quite such an elaborate cabin as some,
but none of the conveniences have been
omitted. The big fireplace, built on rugged
lines, would provide ample heat for the whole
house. Note that a second <i>stone</i> chimney serves
the kitchen&mdash;don&rsquo;t ruin the picture by sticking
a metal stovepipe through the roof.</p>
<p>The interior walls would look well if the
logs were stained or varnished, but for added
warmth it might be wise to cover them with
wallboard. Inexpensive tongue-and-grooved
Oregon pine would be good for the floors,
as they would not be subject to much foot traffic.
If the floors are to be left unvarnished, rub
them with linseed oil as a preservative.</p>
<p>The use of casement-type windows is another
good idea, instead of the ordinary kind. They
are much more decorative, and there&rsquo;s none of
the bother of stringing sash-cords and weights.</p>

</div>
<p>This trio of little guest cabins will probably
be welcomed by those families who have
had the problem of entertaining frequent visitors
in their vacation home, but who like to
maintain a certain amount of privacy that is almost
impossible when a group of people have
to eat and sleep and play in a summer cabin of
limited size.</p>
<p>The guest cabin at the top of the page is one
made of real logs. Visitors will enjoy the chance
to live in a log cabin, and this one is particularly
attractive because its six windows provide
what amounts to a sun room. Such a cabin
would lend a rustic atmosphere to the grounds
of any summer home, even if the main cabin is
built of some other material.</p>
<p>The second cabin, at the right, is a simple affair
built on a wooden frame with a covering
of board and batten. The extension of the roof
to include the porch makes this look like a
much larger structure than it really is. Note
also the treatment of the side windows which
carries out this illusion.</p>
<p>The third little cabin is quite unique, since
it is built of common, ordinary railroad ties!
This is not such a far-fetched idea, either, because
many railroads are willing to sell used
ties, and sometimes even new ones&mdash;and they
can be used to make a most effective log cabin
with only about half the labor required to hew
ordinary logs. Railroads ties are particularly
well suited to a small house, since it is not so
necessary to splice timbers to gain needed
length.</p>
<p>All of these guest cabins consist of a living
room containing either a bunk or double bed,
and a bathroom. No kitchen is provided, since
it is assumed that guests will take their meals
at the main house. However, it is a gracious
gesture&mdash;and one that will be appreciated&mdash;to
provide a single-burner oil stove or an electric
plate, so that breakfast or a late snack may be
prepared without invading the main kitchen.</p>

<p>You&rsquo;d expect to find just such a simple,
homey kind of cabin out &ldquo;back of beyond&rdquo;
where the sky and water meet, because it&rsquo;s the
sort of place just meant for the shores of some
quiet lake or stream. It isn&rsquo;t designed for show,
but for comfort-loving people on vacation.</p>
<p>The artist has given us this cabin with an exterior
finish of redwood boards and battens,
combined with a small amount of stone for
added interest, but the same plan would be
adaptable to almost any treatment&mdash;logs, for
example, laid up in stockade fashion, or milled
redwood siding or even an all-over covering of
hand-split shakes. The roof, by all means,
should be of shakes, stained brown or just left
to the weather.</p>
<p>A stone terrace and a landing stage for boats
is shown in the illustration, but these features
are, of course, optional.</p>
<p>Inside you&rsquo;ll find a 12&frac12; &times; 18&frac12; foot living
room, dominated by a fireplace that takes up
most of one wall, but well lighted by windows
and doors at each end. The fireplace chimney,
incidentally, also serves the kitchen stove.</p>
<p>The two bunk rooms offer ample quarters
for four persons even if twin beds are used, but
in this, as in many modern cabins, it would be
wise to conserve space by using double-deck
bunks. There&rsquo;s plenty of closet space, too&mdash;one
of them even has a window in it.</p>
<p>There are a number of other points of convenience
about this cabin that may not meet
the eye, at first glance. Note the kitchen has its
door opening onto the terrace, making meals
outside much simpler to serve. The bathroom
is far more convenient than some found in
urban homes. Just to keep the whole family
happy, the shower has been placed in a separate
enclosure from the main bathroom.</p>

<p>Another of those rather streamlined summer
homes which some people call &ldquo;functional&rdquo;
style is shown here. Actually, the word simply
means useful, and that is one of the aims of
all good architecture. The effort here has been
to get away from the frills and gingerbread that
make &ldquo;horrors&rdquo; of so many older houses. Although
this was designed for a beach house, it
would do as well in almost any type of location
except a forest site. Streamlines
don&rsquo;t seem quite suitable for a
woods home. If built away from
water, the boat shelter would
make an ideal workshop, laundry
or storehouse.</p>
<p>Construction is of stucco
over wood frame, with a broad,
flat roof extended several feet
for added shade. Naturally, this
flat roof would be unsuitable
for snow country, but it is quite
effective in other sections. The
over-hang, by the way, might
be stained green. Foundations
should all be of reinforced concrete
block, which is strong and
cool. The porch rails may be
either pipe or stained wood.</p>
<p>Inside, the arrangement is extremely simple,
yet interesting. The living and dining areas,
connected with the porch by sliding or folding
doors, can be made into one very large room for
entertaining. On the north side, a long hall connects
the bedroom and bath with other parts of
the house. A slight rearrangement of part of this
hall would make the living room even larger.</p>
<p>The bedroom has accommodations for two
single beds or bunks, and there are two built-in
bunks or divans in the living room.</p>

</div>
<p>Not many families would require as spacious
a cabin as this, but the plan can be
altered in various ways to expand or eliminate
the accommodations as needed. As it is, this
would make a splendid club for an outdoor
group, since it can be built for a fairly reasonable
sum and is not a complicated construction
problem.</p>
<p>The long bunk room, divided by a hall, has
partitioned enclosures which will hold either a
single bed, double bunk or even a two-deck
double bunk, thus providing accommodations
for either four, eight or sixteen persons. Beyond
the bunk room are two dressing rooms and two
baths, making it possible to care for guests of
both sexes conveniently. If additional beds are
necessary, several folding beds could be installed
in the big living room.</p>
<p>The screened porch is a feature that is a
good addition to any cabin. It gives an extra
room&mdash;an ideal place for meals&mdash;and by the
installation of inexpensive hinged windows, the
porch can be used regardless of the weather.</p>
<p>Preparation of meals for as large a group as
may occupy this cabin presents somewhat of
a problem, so the designer has made the kitchen
unusually spacious. Work-tables are shown
along each wall, but these can be reduced to
allow for a refrigerator, large range, etc.</p>
<p>As in the case of the other club house presented
in this book, construction can be as simple
or elaborate as the owners desire. If amateur
labor is going to be used, the wisest choice of
materials would be those requiring the least
technical knowledge. As shown here, the cabin
is wood frame, covered with imitation log
siding combined with flush siding above the
level of the porch railing. The roof is of shakes.</p>

<p>Inspired by a Normandy-French house built
on the shore of Lake Arrowhead, the plan
illustrated here presents a spacious summer
home for a large family or one which does
much entertaining. An idea of the size is indicated
by the fireplace, which has an opening of
9&frac12; &times; 5&frac12; feet, topped by a huge oak beam.</p>
<p>The exterior is pleasingly finished in board
and batten with gable-ends of siding, and a
slate or shake roof. The porch is flagstone with
rustic rail.</p>
<p>The first floor, besides a magnificent living
room, contains a master bedroom and bath,
maid&rsquo;s quarters and the kitchen. Upstairs are
five minimum-size guest rooms and a bath.
Four of the bedrooms are lighted by charming
dormer windows.</p>
<p>An attractive way to finish the interior, to
keep it in the provincial spirit, would be to use
rough plaster walls with exposed ceiling beams
and a plank floor in random widths pinned
with wooden dowels. The furniture should be
hand made, patterned after simple French
peasant styles.</p>
<p>When the owners built the original of this
home they salvaged old hand-wrought iron
pieces from an abandoned construction camp
to make much of the hardware, and for the
rest, they used modern lacquered iron hardware,
with the finish burned off. It was tempered
in hot oil and then hand-hammered to give the
proper look of age.</p>

<p>Some people would be
cramped for space in a
ten-room house, while others
live with perfect freedom in
a pup-tent. It&rsquo;s all a matter of
adapting oneself to the situation.</p>
<p>Here, for example, is a
cabin that might be too small
for two persons, while as a
matter of fact it will sleep six without crowding
at all. That&rsquo;s not just a theory, because a
similar cabin has been used for several years
up in the Mt. Rainier country with great success.
It&rsquo;s just the easy-going, unpretentious sort
of place a man would love, where he can wear
old clothes and let his whiskers grow, and the
odors of coffee and sizzling bacon are sweeter
than the most exotic perfume.</p>
<p>As illustrated this cabin has an exterior of
wide planks and a roof of shakes. It would
make an ideal log cabin, or take any one of a
number of finishes. If any kind of siding is
used, a beautiful effect could be obtained by
use of silver-gray stain. It makes a new cabin
look as if it had stood through
many winters. If shakes or
shingles are used for roofing,
be sure to include about 10
per cent of dark-stained ones
with the lighter colors, to give
a dappled look like sunshine
through the trees.</p>
<p>The real secret of this little
cabin lies in the use of three
folding double beds instead of the regular kind
or bunks. They are hinged at one end and can
be put up out of the way, concealed behind
curtains or cupboard doors. Built-in double-deck
bunks are, of course, a fine addition to any
cabin, but they do cut down the space even in a
23-foot living room.</p>
<p>The little flagstone entry may seem like a
fancy addition to such a cabin, but it is decorative&mdash;and
insures against mud puddles at the
front door.</p>
<p>The kitchen is particularly well arranged,
with lots of work table space and room for storage
shelves above. The bath, although not large,
contains all the comforts of home.</p>

<p>Any family fortunate enough to live near
the ocean will find this house, although
primarily a vacation home, is well suited to a
year-round residence. Along the southern coast
especially there are many such beach houses
whose owners wouldn&rsquo;t think of living in town.</p>
<p>A number of very pleasing ideas have been
included here by the designer. Although this
appears to be just a two-room house, there are
features which make it as commodious as a
four-room one at practically no additional cost.
For example, the living room and bedroom are
the principal parts of the house, but the terrace
provides an ideal outdoor dining room, and the
sun deck is just the place for sleeping out when
the weather is clear.</p>
<p>Stucco on a wood frame sheathed with insulating
board forms the outer walls, and plywood
is used inside. These interior walls could
be plastered, but this would cost slightly more.
All windows, as well as the sliding and folding
doors, have steel frames. Floors are of colored
and polished concrete.</p>
<p>A good color combination would be white
for the exterior, with all exposed woodwork,
such as garage doors, stained tobacco brown.
The terrace rail and the spiral stair should be
tile red. Inside, the most restful finish would be
flat paint in a pastel blue or green, which is
easy on the eyes in a location where there is so
much bright sunlight.</p>
<p>The owner&rsquo;s bedroom, with dressing room
and closet, and the bath adjoining, make a
very convenient unit away from the rest of the
house. A wide closet in the living room will
hold one or more roll-away beds for extra
guests. Also, note the spacious woodbox which
can be stocked from the garage.</p>
<p>The dining terrace, with its decorative tree,
is protected from the wind. From here the
spiral staircase leads to the sun deck over the
bedroom.</p>
<p>The fireplace is a rather necessary feature
even in warm climates. It is of stucco over
concrete blocks. The designer has suggested a
novel idea in this connection: to insure a cool
air space between the ceiling and roof in
summer, a ventilator is run from the ceiling
up the chimney stack.</p>

<p>The inspiration for this charming little
house has come down through the years
from designs used so well by the early Californians,
many of whom brought with them the
traditions of their Mexican and Spanish ancestry.
While the architect, Arthur L. Herberger,
of Los Angeles, specified this as a stucco
dwelling, a favorite medium for this type of
house, it would be an ideal design to work out
in adobe, such as the builders of other days
would have used. As in so many of these old
houses, the front entrance has an air of welcome,
but the patio for private gatherings is placed
at the rear, away from general view.</p>
<p>Adobe clay can be found in many parts of
the West, and if your property happens to have
a bed of this earth, the house can be built for
very little if you do all the work. When all
labor is hired, however, adobe is frequently
more expensive than some other types of construction.
Properly cured adobe blocks last
for centuries.</p>
<p>Two treatments can be suggested for the
front entry. It might be framed with brightly
colored Mexican tiles set into the stucco or
adobe, or the lintel and sides might be made of
heavy hewn timbers.</p>
<p>Whether adobe or stucco is used, the roof
should be of shakes or sun-baked tiles.</p>
<p>Inside, the early day spirit can be carried
out by the use of rather rough plank walls,
whitewashed, or oiled cedar panels. The living
room should extend to the roof, with the rafters
stained brown or painted with a gay Mexican
design. Attention to details, such as the fireplace,
which may be of adobe or other handmade
bricks, and the choice of hardware, will
add much to the charm of such a house.</p>

<p>Here is a big, comfortable cabin of no particular
period of design&mdash;just a grand
place to while away one&rsquo;s leisure time in some
secluded spot where the only sound is the music
of the wind in the pines. The broad flagstone
porch is just the spot to spend lazy afternoons,
and the living room is large enough for entertaining
but not so large that it would be hard
to heat.</p>
<p>According to the original design, this cabin
might be built with a board and batten exterior,
finished with a preparation of linseed
oil and rotten stone&mdash;or it would be beautiful
covered, roof and all, with silver-weathered
shakes or shingles. In either case, the trim
should be in a bright color for contrast, and
the chimney would be best if built of rough
field stones.</p>
<p>Inside, the living room might be finished in
knotty Western cedar vertical-channel boards,
sanded until they feel like satin and rubbed
with linseed oil. Here again, for contrast, the
trim and doors might be painted some bright
color. The designer suggested waxed vermillion
lacquer for the floor, but if this sounds too
bright, it could be left natural color, or perhaps
covered with one of the tile patterns of
inlaid linoleum.</p>
<p>The two bedrooms, just for variety, could be
panelled in knotty pine, while the bathroom
and kitchen would be nice in some gay color
such as canary yellow.</p>
<p>The arrangement of the fireplace at the back
of the house allows construction of a feature
which is especially popular in southern California&mdash;an
outdoor fireplace. A single chimney
carries both flues. The inner fireplace may be
used for heating purposes, while the outside
one is ideal for barbecues on the terrace.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s a thoroughly modern little cabin
with very trim lines. It will fit into almost
any sort of sloping site. Shown here, it&rsquo;s a
mountain cabin with stone foundations forming
the walls of a garage for two cars. However,
with only a few minor changes, the same plan
could be used for a beach house, and the
garage could be transformed into a boat house.</p>
<p>Construction details are quite simple. The
foundations, stairway and retaining walls are
stone, which can often be had for nothing on
the site. The upper structure is wood frame,
covered outside with milled siding. The studding
is so planned as to make application of
wallboard or plywood very easy, for the interior.</p>
<p>If the cabin is to be built in snow country,
such a flat roof would have to be supported
with unusually strong beams. The simplest covering
would be composition roofing. To provide
a serviceable walking surface, a wood
floor raised on slats should go over this built
up rooting. Another excellent&mdash;and cheap&mdash;roofing
for a deck that will have considerable
foot traffic is made by applying canvas over
the matched roof boarding, just like the deck
of a boat. If kept painted, this type of roofing
is entirely satisfactory.</p>
<p>This is essentially a one-room structure, but
it includes in a compact space all the conveniences
of a much larger house. At one end of
the living area is a small but complete kitchen,
screened by a cupboard. On the reverse side of
this cupboard is a hinged table that swings
down at meal times.</p>
<p>Sleeping quarters include two double-deck
bunks against one wall, with closet room at one
end and the bathroom at the other. This entire
area can be screened off with sliding curtains
hung from a ceiling track. There is also room
for a couch or day bed on one side of the fireplace.
Wood storage is outside, but the small
closet by the fireplace could be used for this.</p>
<p>Another interesting feature is the barbecue
on the roof deck. It is built into the chimney,
but if such an item adds too much to the cost, a
portable barbecue would do quite as well.</p>

<p>For anyone who wants
to satisfy that inner
urge to live in a real log
cabin, no better guide
could be followed than the
plans shown here. A glance
at the illustration really
doesn&rsquo;t give an idea of the
roominess and comfort of
the place that is apparent
from a study of the floor
plan. However, this cabin
would be quite a task for
an amateur builder to undertake.</p>
<p>The original of this
cabin was built by the
Hugo Eastmans on a knoll
in the Santa Cruz mountains.
The rustic idea is carried
out in every detail,
with real logs, a rough
stone fireplace and rugged rafters, but inside
are all the conveniences of a modern residence.
A pergola of rustic poles shades the front
entrance.</p>
<p>Because of the size of the cabin it is unnecessary
to crowd the living room with beds. There
is one, but it folds up and
is concealed in a closet.
There are two comfortable
bedrooms, each with private
bath. One of the baths
opens into the kitchen also.</p>
<p>Since this is a real log
cabin, every possible detail
should be made of this
material, including door
and window trim, porch
rail and possibly the living
room furniture. The
floor should be of random-width
planks, pinned with
wooden dowels.</p>
<p>Light is an important factor
in a log cabin, so much
care should go into planning
the color scheme. If
the cabin is of peeled logs,
the most beautiful interior
finish would be to give the walls a couple of
coats of clear varnish. This brings out the whiteness
of the logs and makes them easy to keep
clean.</p>
<p>The bedrooms, for contrast, might be done in
greenish blue and the kitchen in grey or tan.</p>

<p>The building of any sort of
a vacation cabin represents
quite an investment for the average
family, and it is sometimes
necessary to omit or hold back on
certain features in order to make
the budget work out. The plan illustrated
here is a splendid example
of a charming cabin that
started as a modest little place
with just the minimum amount
of room.</p>
<p>In its first stage, the owner can erect the central
frame, which includes the living room, a
bunk-room, kitchen and bath. This all fits into
a 19- &times; 20-foot structure, and may be sheathed
on the outside with board and batten, as above,
or any type of material that fits the
budget. A feature adding a great deal
of charm is the pair of casement windows
at the front.</p>
<p>This much of the house could be built
the first year, with perhaps a temporary
shelter for the car at the rear. The following
season, or as soon as needed, two
real bedrooms could be added on one
side, utilizing the space formerly taken
by bunks for closets. It will be noted in
the plan marked &ldquo;Second Stage&rdquo; that a
stairway to a cellar is indicated,
but the cellar, of course, is optional.</p>
<p>On the opposite side of the
house, the garage may be constructed,
either attached directly
to the house, or as shown here,
with a small porch and a breakfast
room in between.</p>
<p>Following the style of many of
the recent houses, this design uses
a nice combination of board and
batten and fitted masonry.</p>
<p>This plan was designed by Howard H. Riley,
Seattle architect, and was furnished through
the courtesy of the West Coast Lumbermen&rsquo;s
Association.</p>

</div>
<p>This plan of a two-family
cabin is presented as a result
of numerous requests from Pacific
Coast families who want to
enjoy their vacations together.
The problem is somewhat more
difficult than planning a single
house, but the features illustrated
here should make it possible
to give two families a cabin
at only slightly higher cost than
an ordinary one.</p>
<p>The construction of such a
cabin, in most cases, must be
fairly reasonable. Therefore, the
one here is built of wood frame
covered with board and batten, on a low concrete
foundation. Roofing may be of any type
that meets the budget.</p>
<p>A large living room with a massive fireplace
is the central feature inside. Here both families
may gather, or they may find privacy on
separate porches on either side.</p>
<p>Since meals would probably be eaten at the
same time by both groups, the kitchen and
dining alcove have been made common to both
sides.</p>
<p>The most interesting feature, and one which
should please everybody, is a separate suite of
sleeping quarters, one at each end of the cabin,
for each family. Two bunk rooms, holding
either a double bed or a double-deck bunk, with
necessary closet space, will accommodate four
or eight persons in each suite. The bunk rooms
open on a short hall connecting with the bathroom.</p>
<p>An interesting way to finish such a cabin
would be to leave the rafters and beams exposed
in the main living room, where a truly rustic
atmosphere is most desirable. If these timbers
are given a hewn surface and stained brown,
they make a pleasing contrast to walls of natural-color
knotty pine. The floor should be
made of broad planks, to be in scale with the
size of the room.</p>

<p>In a vacation area where life is
maintained on a more or less
civilized plane, this vacation home,
with its very modern lines, would
be quite attractive. By &ldquo;civilized,&rdquo;
we mean that you could hardly imagine
anyone loafing on the terrace
in dirty old canvas slacks and a
week&rsquo;s set of whiskers.</p>
<p>The plan is intended for a sloping
site, with floors on four levels
beginning with the garage at the
highest point. The roof is flat and
may be transformed into a sun deck.
Foundations are concrete, with
wood frame covered with flush siding
above. Inside, the walls may be
covered with wall board, left natural
color except in kitchen and
baths.</p>
<p>The living room is two stories high, with a
balcony occupied by two double bunks. The
master&rsquo;s bedroom and private bath, as well as
a guest bath, are on this balcony level also.</p>
<p>Down a short flight of stairs from the living
room is a dining alcove and the kitchen. The
dining alcove opens on a spacious terrace.</p>
<p>This same plan, with a few minor changes
such as the addition of a shower at the first floor
entry, would make a fine beach house.</p>

<p>This quaint little cottage, with its low roof
and wide porches, is another good example
of what can be done with the simplest of floor
plans. It really consists of just one big square
room, with partitions jutting out to form the
bathroom and kitchen. Anyone can go that far
without the guidance of an architect or builder,
but the added touches of an experienced hand,
as evidenced in the porch rail, the little
martin house on the roof and the stepped-back
patio wall, are what give this cabin
its distinctive charm.</p>
<p>As shown here, the walls are of board
and batten, with hand-split shakes laid on
the roof in an irregular pattern. The bird
house is an attractive note frequently
used on old-world houses. The quaint line
of the chimney is achieved by extending
the tile flues above the masonry and curving
the concrete fill up against them.</p>
<p>Since this cabin has such inviting
porches, we have shown only one double
bunk inside. Most families will prefer to
sleep outside, and since the porch is protected
by the overhang of the roof on two
sides, several beds could be put there and
screened from view by sliding curtains.
As a convenience for those who do sleep out, an
outer door to the bathroom has been included.</p>
<p>The kitchen is unusually roomy for a place
of this size. It has ample work room and a door
opening on the patio for convenience when
serving meals out of doors.</p>
<p>Another charming feature of this little cabin
is the unusual treatment of the bathroom
window. It is screened by small lattices.</p>

<p>For the man who likes
to go back to his favorite
trout stream or
hunting country each
year, yet who doesn&rsquo;t
want to go to the trouble
and expense of a
permanent cabin, this
little log and stone shelter
is just about perfect.
Two men can build the
whole thing in a few
days, using only materials
that can be picked up right on
the spot. Even the roof shakes can
be home-made.</p>
<p>Since a hunting lodge is used in
cold weather, it would be wise to
have the floor raised off the earth
a few inches, either with an all-around
stone foundation as shown
here, or with a series of flat boulders.
The latter, however, do not
keep out much of the cold.</p>
<p>Hunters don&rsquo;t demand many luxuries
when they&rsquo;re out in the wilds, so
only the barest comforts have been
provided here. By installing an iron
grill in the fireplace, most of the
cooking could be done over the coals,
thus saving the space occupied by the
oil stove.</p>
<p>There is just room enough for two
single bunks or folding cots. To save
the trouble of packing in a lot of bedding,
it would be a good idea to use
sleeping bags and air-mattresses.</p>

<p>Proper construction is a most important
point in a beach house such as the one
above, because unless the house is well built,
your vacation by the sea can be a pretty miserable
affair. Cold damp winds have a way of
finding chinks in the walls and sand <i>will</i> blow
under the windows unless they&rsquo;re properly
fitted.</p>
<p>The board and batten walls of this beach
house are as satisfactory as any you can select.
Moisture-laden atmosphere is not as likely to
affect this kind of material, especially if it is
well painted. Incidentally, when buying paint
for your beach house, be sure to get the best,
because salt air is very hard on paint. Pay a
little more at first and save the work of a paint
job next season.</p>
<p>A shake roof would look nice on such a
house, and would be satisfactory if the shakes
were stained. Composition shingles, perhaps,
would be a good idea, too, but they do not make
such an interesting roof.</p>
<p>The interior plan of this house makes it a
good one either for week-ends or for semi-permanent
use. Indeed, if you like to commute,
it could be occupied all year &rsquo;round, since it has
all the comforts of a modern city home. There&rsquo;s
one master bedroom, connected directly with
the bath, and a large bunk room for guests. If
bunks are used here, be sure to build them along
the lines of a ship&rsquo;s berth, just for a nautical
atmosphere.</p>
<p>As a matter of fact, a beach house is just the
place where lots of imagination can be used.
Door knobs and other hardware of bright
brass, a colored ship&rsquo;s lamp over the front door,
and perhaps a couple of real portholes instead
of the small windows in the bunk room and the
bath, would lend a very salty air. Such items
can be bought at any ship chandler&rsquo;s. The living
room, for example, might have a &ldquo;deck&rdquo; of

<p>The amazing things that can
be done in a limited space
with a curtain or two and some
careful planning with furniture,
are nowhere better demonstrated
than in this one-room cabin. The
designer started with nothing
but an 18 &times; 20-foot rectangle for
a floor plan, yet he has evolved a
comfortable week-end cabin for
at least four persons.</p>
<p>The exterior walls of this
cabin have been treated in an
unusual manner which makes something quite
unique out of what might have been just another
cabin. The end walls, chimney and porch
are constructed of rough-hewn stone, while the
front and rear walls are board and batten. The
roof could be shakes, shingles or slates. Of
course, this same cabin could be built any one
of a number of ways, using logs or shingles instead
of the stone and wood combination. The
front door, to carry out the atmosphere of simplicity,
should be of planks.</p>
<p>The cabin, which was the inspiration for the
one illustrated here, had an interior of cedar
panels, uncolored except for a treatment with
hot oil. This makes a good wall finish, although
if you prefer them, plywood or
wall board would be appropriate
and not costly. Because of its
limited size, perhaps a light interior
of natural or tinted wall
board would be most satisfactory.</p>
<p>Just inside the front door, at
the left, is a kitchenette with two
built-in seats and a drop-table to
form a dinette such as many
apartments have. Additional
seats may be built on the other
side of the kitchenette if desired.</p>
<p>At the far end of the room is a space for two
double beds or bunks. The latter would be more
pleasing, since they offer attractive lounging
places during the day. Between the bunks is a
washroom and two closets which form a partition
and divide the space into two bedrooms.
A sliding curtain conceals the bedroom end
when desired.</p>
<p>Because this is intended simply as a week-end
cabin, no provision is made for an inside
toilet. However, it would be entirely feasible
to add an adjoining room at the rear for a
complete bathroom.</p>

</div>
<p>Make your vacation home as comfortable as
you can for the amount of money you have
to spend. Remember that the four major comforts
in any house are light, heat, water, and
cooking facilities.</p>
<p>Proper lighting is one of the most important
comforts. You can get water from a stream and
boil it, if you have to; you can cook and warm
yourself with a fireplace, but you will find it
harmful to your eyes to depend entirely upon
candles or ordinary kerosene lamps for light.
If you are building within range of power lines,
by all means install electric lights, even if it
costs a little more than you had planned to
spend. If you want primitive effects, you can
get them very effectively by a proper choice of
fixtures without sacrificing good lighting.</p>
<p>Next best to public utility power is your own
private electric plant, operated by a gasoline
engine. Such an installation, consisting of engine,
generator and storage battery, may be had
for as little as $75.00, not including wiring the
cabin itself. This minimum-priced outfit will
light a small cabin and operate an electric iron
and toaster. You can go as much higher as you
want up to a $1500 installation, which will supply
almost enough power for a small summer
resort.</p>
<p>If you must get along without electricity, the
best portable devices are gasoline lamps and
lanterns. You should have several of them.
They burn with a mantle like old-fashioned gas
but give an intense white light and use ordinary
gasoline. Be sure, though, not to use gasoline
treated with tetra-ethyl lead. These lights
are satisfactory for reading, and you can take
a gasoline lantern out in a storm without danger
of its blowing out.</p>
<p>In most cases, if you use your cabin only in
summer, the fireplace will provide sufficient
heat, especially if you have the air circulating
kind so located that the warm air can be utilized
in adjoining rooms. If more heat is required,
and it will be if you use the cabin in
winter, investigate the oil-burning heaters that
combine directed heat with heat circulation and
heat radiation. Portable oil or electric heaters
are also handy at any time of the year. Central
heating is generally not necessary unless your
cabin is to be used as a year-round home.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig18">
<img src="images/p25f.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="355" />
<p class="pcap">Even though your cabin is beyond reach
of gas and electricity, you need not be
without modern kitchen conveniences.
Oil burning ranges and refrigerators provide
the same service as found in a modern
city home.</p>
</div>
<p>If you are going in for real cabin comfort,
you will naturally have running water in the
<span class="pb" id="Page_50">50</span>
kitchen and bath. The next step in comfort is an
adequate supply of hot water. Electric, gas- or
oil-burning equipment will give you all the hot
water you want.</p>
<p>With an insulated storage tank you can have
automatic hot water with an electric heater. The
cost will depend on your power rate and you
must decide if it fits your purse. If you have one
of the so-called &ldquo;bottled gas&rdquo; installations, you
can use this fuel for your hot water. An oil
burning water heater will provide an adequate
supply of hot water at reasonable cost.</p>
<p>Water-heating coils in the back of the fireplace
or in a wood burning stove provide inexpensive
hot water, but not always timely or
in adequate amounts. It is possible to connect
these coils with a storage tank that is also
heated by oil or gas appliances, so that you
only use this fuel when the fireplace or stove
does not supply enough hot water.</p>
<p>Probably one of the most neglected comforts
in the average cabin is the kitchen in general
and the cook stove in particular. If the cook is
to have as good a time as the rest of the family,
the cabin kitchen should be modern and conveniently
arranged. A wood burning cook stove
does not add to the pleasures of feeding the
family and guests. But a possible point to consider:
a kitchen range is an excellent added
heater in a cabin that is to be used in cold
weather.</p>
<p>Today&rsquo;s cabinet type oil range, with burners
and fuel reservoir concealed, is as attractive in
appearance as the modern gas or electric range.
Burners are quick in performance and adjustable
to any degree of heat desired. &ldquo;Bottled
gas&rdquo; installations are also practical if your
cabin is located where it can be serviced by the
sales representative. The gas, compressed to
liquid form in a steel cylinder, is piped to your
stove like ordinary city gas. However, burners
must be especially adjusted for it, or if you are
buying a new stove, get one made for this fuel.</p>
<p>Refrigeration adds to the comforts of cabin
life as much as to city life. If you have electricity,
you can use the conventional electric
refrigerator. Also available are mechanical refrigerators
that use gas. Modern oil burning
refrigerators also give effective performance
and are usable anywhere, requiring no outside
connections. There are two types&mdash;one having
a continuous flame and the other requiring the
burners to be lit about two hours a day, the
burners going out automatically when the required
quantity of oil has been consumed.</p>
<p>While the space may of necessity be smaller,
the kitchen of the vacation home deserves as
much thought in planning as that in the city
house. Apply the same principles of convenience
and workable arrangement and provide
plenty of storage space, for the family on vacation
does not ordinarily go food shopping every
day. On the following pages you will find a
number of kitchen conveniences that with a
little planning can be incorporated into your
cabin kitchen.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig19">

<p class="pcap">This diagram shows how the hot water tank can be
connected with heating coils in the back of the fireplace

<h3>Native Stone Lends Charm and Ruggedness to Cabin
<br />Fireplaces and Barbecues</h3>
<p>Native stone, gathered from near the site,
seems to be the most popular material for
the cabin fireplace or barbecue. Skillfully handled,
it may be adapted to a variety of artistic
treatments, and it lends to the cabin, inside and
out, the atmosphere of ruggedness sought after
by most cabin builders. Sometimes the stones
are gathered one by one over a wide area for
their appearance, beauty and other characteristics,
so the fireplace itself becomes almost a
collector&rsquo;s item to those who have gathered far
and wide the material for its construction.
Where stones of the proper size are not available,
they are frequently blasted from larger
boulders.</p>
<p>The various ideas for indoor and outdoor
fireplaces and barbecues shown here have been
sketched from photographs of fireplaces actually
built in Western cabins. They show some
of the wide possibilities of design and of decorative
treatment. Among them, or from a combination
of their various features, you should
be able to find the design of your ideal fireplace.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig20">
<img src="images/p26d.jpg" alt="" width="518" height="601" />
<p class="pcap">This attractive all-stone
fireplace shows what a little ingenuity
can do in arranging a mantel
without the use of wood or set-back
in the masonry. A carefully selected
long flat stone, imbedded in the
chimney wall and supported by
three oblong stones, makes the mantel
and adds a touch of master
craftsmanship to the entire fireplace.</p>

<p class="pcap">For a large cabin room
this massive fireplace lends an air
of warmth and comfort. The
large mantel area is obtained by
building the fireplace out into
the room and setting back the
chimney. Suggested by the fireplace

<p class="pcap">Increased floor area in the smaller
cabin is obtained by setting the fireplace back
flush with the walls. The chimney could have
been set back still farther and covered, but
running the stone work to the roof breaks up
a long wall.</p>

massive stones that shows still another mantel
arrangement. In this case the mantel is a
quarter log supported by two heavy hewn

The bar support for kettles is even more pioneerish
than a pot and crane and in keeping
with rugged charm of the fireplace itself.</p>

<h2 id="c11"><span class="small">Outdoor Cooking Awakens Primitive Impulses and Sharpens Vacation Appetites</span></h2>
<p>All the world likes to return to the primitive
at times. In most cases this return takes the
form of cooking and eating a meal outdoors.
There is something about a fire outdoors that
awakens impulses lost in us ages ago. And a
well cooked outdoor meal makes hearty vacation
appetites even keener.</p>
<p>Since the purpose of your vacation home is
to get closer to nature, you should plan to get
the most out of it by providing facilities for
cooking and eating at least some of your meals
in the open. On the other hand, you will want
to arrange to have greater convenience than the
open fire on the surface of the ground that
served your ancestors long ago. The outdoor
grill, or an outdoor fireplace with a grill built
in, provides the comfort and facilities that the
modern generation demands.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig27">
<img src="images/p27h.jpg" alt="" width="506" height="415" />
<p class="pcap">This barbecue grill and fireplace built in
the stump of a great redwood looks as if the tree had
actually grown around it. From the E. D. Thompson
summer home at Ben Lomond, California.</p>
</div>
<div class="img" id="fig28">
<img src="images/p27k.jpg" alt="" width="748" height="684" />
<p class="pcap">This barbecue layout consists of grill,
oven, and separate fireplace. The oven is heated by
the draft from the fireplace or barbecue, which
passes around it, but it may also
have a separate firebox. Note the
handy adjustable grill, which is one
of several types sold by Pacific Coast
manufacturers.</p>
</div>
<div class="img" id="fig29">
<img src="images/p27m.jpg" alt="" width="558" height="499" />
<p class="pcap">An isolated area surrounded by trees and
shrubbery makes an ideal setting for the outdoor
fireplace. Be sure, however, that there is no dense
growth overhead to interfere with the draft. Large
logs make rustic seats, one on each side. Place the
rough table about ten feet away with split logs for
benches.</p>
</div>
<p>Outdoor grills range from the simplest form
U-shaped brick cooking place, covered with a
heavy steel screening, to huge affairs of brick
<span class="pb" id="Page_54">54</span>
or stone with chimneys and dampers, Dutch
ovens built into the sides, warming places for
plates, and perhaps a roaring separate fireplace
to soften the chill of the evening air. All of
them are relatively easy to build and reasonably
inexpensive. However, you must keep the
fire hazards in mind, and in the National Forests,
before you begin to build, have your forest
officer approve your plan and location.</p>
<p>Construction of the outdoor fireplace is much
the same as that of an indoor one except that
the chimney and flue are not carried to such a
height. Nor does the footing need to be as thick
unless your fireplace is very heavy. A concrete
base eight inches thick with four inches of this
above ground is usually ample. You may use
the chimney of your cabin fireplace for your
outdoor fireplace or grill but be sure to provide
a separate flue.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig30">
<img src="images/p28.jpg" alt="" width="524" height="470" />
<p class="pcap">Here is a combination outdoor fireplace
and grill large enough to cook for the neighborhood.
After the steaks are broiled, large logs can be rolled
in to provide a roaring fire for the evening. The grill
can be supported by a three-sided frame of firebricks
built up to the proper height.</p>
</div>
<div class="img" id="fig31">
<img src="images/p28a.jpg" alt="" width="539" height="430" />
<p class="pcap">The feature of this barbecue and oven is a
sliding fire pan. The fire may be used to heat the oven
until the coals are ready and then slid across under
the grill, or with two pans both grill and oven may
be heated at the same time.</p>
</div>
<div class="img" id="fig32">
<img src="images/p28e.jpg" alt="" width="415" height="332" />
<p class="pcap">To make this barbecue pit, a framework
was built up of an old barrel and scrap lumber and
then covered with concrete. A slow fire burned out
the wood when the concrete had hardened. It is set
on a platform of concrete and bricks against a rough
chimney of rock.</p>
</div>
<div class="img" id="fig33">
<img src="images/p28f.jpg" alt="" width="434" height="323" />
<p class="pcap">This barbecue of stone is built with the
firebox and grill at a convenient height. A chimney
is desirable but not necessary. Note the device for
raising and lowering the grill.</p>
</div>
<p>There are several methods of adapting the
outdoor fireplace to cooking. The simplest is to
provide yourself with a pair of rather high
andirons and a grill to lay over the top of them.
The grill may also be hinged to rear of the fireplace
or you may install sliding adjustable
grill as illustrated. A pot and crane adds to the
appearance as well as the utility of the outdoor
fireplace.</p>
<p>The design of the barbecue grill or outdoor
stove is a matter for your own taste. For comfort&rsquo;s
sake you will want to have the grill top
<span class="pb" id="Page_55">55</span>
about the height of your kitchen stove. Build up
the firebox so that when the coals are glowing,
they will be about eight inches below the grill,
which should be made of &sup3;/&#8321;&#8326;-inch steel rods
spaced about one inch apart in a metal frame.
A groove or seat for the grill may be made in
the masonry, or you may provide supports by
imbedding projecting pieces of iron in the firebox
walls. A piece of sheet steel laid over the
grill will provide a fry plate when one is
needed.</p>
<p>A chimney is a good addition to a grill of this
type. It not only adds some architectural character
but it will draw off fumes and give a better
draft to your fire. And if you want even
more efficiency, you can include some sort of
damper arrangement to control the draught.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig34">
<img src="images/p28g.jpg" alt="" width="469" height="351" />
<p class="pcap">This outdoor stove is simple to construct
and may be used for cooking over flame or broiling
over live coals. You can make it even simpler by
omitting the chimney and the door on the front of
the firebox.</p>
</div>
<div class="img" id="fig35">
<img src="images/p28h.jpg" alt="" width="470" height="380" />
<p class="pcap">For roasts over the coals a revolving spit
is indispensable. A half-inch iron bar can be bent in
the form of a crank at one end, sharpened at the
other, and set in a pair of bearings or saddles designed
to straddle the walls of the firepit.</p>
</div>
<div class="img" id="fig36">
<img src="images/p28k.jpg" alt="" width="528" height="582" />
<p class="pcap">You don&rsquo;t have to wait for good outdoor
weather to enjoy grilled steaks if your fireplace is
equipped with a hinged grill that hooks up out of
the way when the fireplace is not being used for
cooking. For this type of grill use &frac14;-inch rods
spaced about 1&frac14; inches apart. The andirons, or metal
legs attached to the grill, keep it at the right height
from the floor.</p>
</div>
<div class="img" id="fig37">
<img src="images/p28m.jpg" alt="" width="542" height="578" />
<p class="pcap">A pot and crane add interest to the cabin
fireplace, whether it is indoors or out. Any wrought
iron shop can make this crane. You might even get it
done by the country blacksmith.</p>

<div class="img" id="fig38">
<img src="images/p29.jpg" alt="" width="528" height="360" />
<p class="pcap">Another way to convert an ordinary fireplace
into a barbecue is to install a sliding grill. By
providing additional slides you may adjust the height
from the coals. Two types of metal slides are shown.
Don&rsquo;t forget, when having the grill made, to adjust
its shape to the side walls of the fireplace and to allow
for heat expansion.</p>
</div>
<div class="img" id="fig39">
<img src="images/p29c.jpg" alt="" width="554" height="308" />
<p class="pcap">A barbecue belt is a
great convenience in keeping
important accessories handy
when you are cooking in the open. You can make one
of leather or oilcloth or several thicknesses of cotton
material interlined with buckram. Make pockets to
hold the salt and pepper shakers, provide clasps for
your pot holders and loops to hold your fork and
spoon. Now you are ready to cook. If you prefer,
you can build these features into a chef&rsquo;s apron.</p>

<img src="images/p29e.jpg" alt="" width="267" height="363" />
<p class="pcap">Fireplace tools
that stay up out of the way when not in use may
be hand forged by any good blacksmith or
wrought iron worker. A simple bracket with projecting
prongs, as illustrated, is fastened to the
fireplace wall and each tool hangs by a collar.
Rough forged tools are more in keeping with the
cabin effect than the factory-finished kind. If the
maker is skillful enough, the heads may be made in
various designs. Animal heads are popular.</p>
</div>
<div class="img" id="fig41">

<p class="pcap">Discarded railroad rails make excellent
material for hand-forged andirons that are heavy
enough and crude enough for any cabin. Simply
have the blacksmith turn up one end of each piece
of rail. If you want to be more original, you can have
the end forged into some special design, as shown.</p>

<p class="pcap">A handy supply of wood is a great convenience
in the cabin. So, plan a woodbox when you
plan the fireplace. Here is one built in the fireplace
wall. You can put a door on it, if you wish, but the
exposed wood does not look out of place in the cabin.
Don&rsquo;t overlook the possibility of a two-way woodbox
that can be filled from the outside or from the
garage or wherever the wood is stored.</p>

<p>If old furniture must be used, try the magic
of paint. It is wonderful what may be accomplished
with some cans of paint and brushes.
Then cover the old seating pieces with some
gay cretonne slip covers, use the same fabrics
at the windows, and a cheerful, colorful result
is obtained.</p>
<p>When refinishing old furniture try remodeling
it to fit its new surroundings. Chest and
chairs and such, dating from the early days of
the century, are likely to have a lot of gingerbread
decoration. By removing as much of this
as possible and getting down to the simple
basic lines of the piece much improvement may
be made.</p>

<p class="pcap">Folding or sliding doors from the living

the cabin. If you have double-deck bunks on the

an arrangement in the Walter Doty home, Los

<p>Before painting any piece previously coated
with shellac or varnish go over it with varnish
remover or use a hook scraper and steel wool,
cleaning down to the bare wood. Apply a coat
of flat white and, when dry, at least two coats
of one of the quick-drying enamels. Go over
each coat with very fine sandpaper or steel wool
<span class="pb" id="Page_59">59</span>
and brush off the resulting dust before applying
the next coat.</p>
<p>If you are working with maple, walnut or
cherry, the natural color of the wood is often
more pleasing than a paint or stain. Remove all
traces of enamel, stain or varnish and sand the
surfaces smooth. Then apply a thin coat of
clear shellac&mdash;orange if you prefer&mdash;and after
sanding this once more polish with ordinary
prepared wax.</p>

<h2 id="c13"><span class="small">A Score and More of Cabin Ideas</span></h2>
<p>Rustic furniture, of course, is attractive in
most cabins, but it frequently takes considerable
skill and ingenuity to make it comfortable.</p>
<p>Where considerable room is required to
sleep weekend party guests, give a thought to
furniture and fixtures that can be converted
into comfortable beds on short notice. Studio
couches provide lounging by day and sleeping
by night. Double-deck bunks use a minimum of
floor space and provide attractive and comfortable
sleeping accommodations. Hinged wall
beds that disappear under shelves and curtains
or into closets are likewise popular.</p>

<p class="pcap">The apartment idea of using cupboards to
divide the kitchen and the dining alcove merits consideration
when you are planning your cabin. These
cupboards give you the effect of two separate rooms
and, of course, supply a good deal of storage space
without taking up valuable floor space.</p>
</div>
<h3>Mountain Cabin Pictures</h3>
<p>A mountain cabin scarcely requires the conventional
kind of pictures on the walls. However,
here are two kinds that fit the cabin picture.
Have some extra large enlargements
made of photographs of your choicest scenic
spots. Mount these and frame them with strips
of cedar bark. Geological survey maps or the
forest service maps of your vicinity, similarly
framed, are an appropriate cabin decoration.</p>
<h3>Metal Lined Closets</h3>
<p>It is a good idea in every mountain cabin to
provide one metal lined closet with floor space
the size of a single bed mattress and high
enough to store your entire supply of mattresses
and bedding, as well as other things you
do not wish to go into chipmunks&rsquo; and packrats&rsquo;
warehouses. Tin or zinc is a satisfactory
lining. One or two metal lined food storage
compartments should also be provided in the
cabin kitchen.</p>

<p class="pcap">This old-fashioned but rustic dining room
table is easy to build. Four seasoned posts, some
heavy plank, and a supply of nails complete the bill

rustic chairs are used with it.</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_63">63</div>
<h3>Starting the Fireplace Fire</h3>
<p>A cupful (not more) of Diesel oil over the
laid hearth fire just before lighting is a safe
starter with no flare such as kerosene gives. It
allows a successful immediate fire with no
paper, less kindling, and greater warmth.
Diesel oil is efficient and cheap, and the small
quantity used for this purpose seems to make
no obvious increase of soot. Its safety and
cheapness can lead to many adaptations of it
as a fire starter in camp or lodge.</p>
<p>If members of your family are not familiar
with lighting such fires, warn them against
tossing gasoline or kerosene on the flames.
It is positively dangerous.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig73">
<img src="images/p32d.jpg" alt="" width="460" height="668" />
<p class="pcap">Ordinarily there isn&rsquo;t space for a bath tub in the
average cabin, but a shower is usually acceptable to all but
the very small members of the family. If you have young
children, you can solve the problem by walling up the
shower with cement to a height of two feet from the floor
and providing for a stopper in the drain. This makes a small
tub that young children will appreciate, and it is easy for
adults to step over the wall.</p>

<h2 id="c14"><span class="small">BIBLIOGRAPHY</span></h2>
<p>Ever since the first man came down out of a tree and set up housekeeping
in a cave, he has been interested in making his dwelling more
comfortable and more beautiful. Naturally, the amount of material
that has been written on the subject has been enormous, because man
is also interested in telling his neighbors all about it. As a prospective
cabin builder, undoubtedly you will want to read more fully on the
subject of houses and methods of construction. The various books listed
below should prove helpful. They are among the most recent works
published, and should be readily obtainable from any good book
dealer. If you are building a vacation home, you will find them a source
of knowledge as well as inspiration.</p>

<h3>Government Bulletins</h3>
<p>For the amateur builder, one of the best sources of concise, authoritative
information is the series of bulletins issued by the Government
Printing Office at Washington for the Department of Agriculture. They
are called &ldquo;Farmers&rsquo; Bulletins&rdquo; because they are intended for use on
farms, but the material they contain is applicable to the cabin builder&rsquo;s
needs, since conditions on a farm and out in the woods, as regards
plumbing, sanitation, water supply, etc., are identical. If you want
copies of these pamphlets, write to the Superintendent of Documents,
Government Printing Office, Washington, D. C., enclosing 5c for each
one.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
